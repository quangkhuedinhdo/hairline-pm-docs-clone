## Executive Summary

Enable secure, auditable, real-time messaging and audio/video communication between patients and providers across the Hairline platform to support quote clarification, procedure coordination, and patient care. Patients can communicate directly with providers throughout their journey from quote review through post-procedure phases via text messaging, media sharing, and live audio/video calls. Admins monitor all conversations with keyword flagging and can intervene ONLY in emergency situations (serious policy violations, urgent disputes, patient safety emergencies). The module supports text and media messages, audio/video calls via Twilio, read receipts, conversation history, and real-time notifications, improving response times, patient reassurance, provider communication efficiency, and operational transparency while meeting medical data privacy obligations.

- Patient ↔ Hairline Support general help (may be added in future release; currently handled outside messaging module).
- Patient ↔ Aftercare Team specialized support (may be added in future release; currently handled outside messaging module).

### Entry Points

**Automatic Chat Creation**: When a provider submits their **first quote** for a patient inquiry, the system automatically creates a new chat conversation between that patient and provider. The conversation appears immediately in both parties' message inboxes. If the same patient-provider pair later has additional inquiries/quotes, they continue using the **same unified conversation** (one conversation per patient-provider pair, regardless of number of quotes).

**Patient Platform**: Patients access their Messages/Inbox screen (Screen 1) from the main navigation in the mobile app. The inbox displays all conversations with providers who have sent quotes, with filtering and search capabilities. Patients tap a conversation to open the full chat view (Screen 2). Chat is NOT accessible from quote detail screens—only from the dedicated inbox. Conversations remain accessible from quote received through post-procedure phases.

**Provider Platform**: Providers access patient conversations through a Messages popup/submenu in the header navigation (Screen 3), showing recent conversations with unread counts. The popup provides quick access to recent messages; tapping a conversation opens the full chat view (Screen 4). New conversations appear when providers submit quotes. Chat is NOT accessible from quote detail or inquiry screens—only from the dedicated messages list.

**Admin Platform**: Admins access the Communication Monitoring Center from the Admin platform navigation (Screen 5), which serves as the comprehensive message list monitoring all patient-provider conversations (and any admin-patient communications). The center includes advanced filtering by patient, provider, service, quote/inquiry ID, date range, flags, and intervention status. Selecting a conversation opens the detailed Message Thread View (Screen 6A) for review and flagging; admins can activate Emergency Intervention mode (Screen 6B) if critical situation requires direct messaging.

**Notifications**: Push/email notifications deep-link users directly into the specific conversation in their inbox. Keyword flags alert admins and deep-link to flagged conversations for review.

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Patient ↔ Provider Messaging

**Actors**: Patient, Provider, Admin (emergency monitoring), System  
**Trigger**: Provider submits a quote for a patient inquiry  
**Outcome**: Conversation available (created if first quote, or existing conversation reused if subsequent quote); patient and provider can exchange messages; conversation logged; admin can monitor and intervene only in emergencies

**Steps**:

1. Provider submits quote for patient inquiry; system checks if conversation already exists for this patient-provider pair:
   - **If first quote**: System creates a new conversation, adds inquiry/quote ID.
   - **If subsequent quote**: System adds new inquiry/quote ID to existing conversation's quote_references array.
2. Conversation appears in patient's Messages/Inbox (Screen 1) and provider's Messages/Inbox immediately (or moves to top if existing); patient sees conversation preview with provider name and unread badge.
3. Patient opens their Messages/Inbox, sees new conversation with unread badge, taps to open full chat (Screen 2).
4. Patient composes a text message with questions (e.g., about procedure, packages, pricing, timing) and optionally attaches media; taps Send.
5. System validates content (size/type), records the message, and updates conversation state.
6. System delivers real-time notification to Provider and updates unread counters in provider's inbox.
7. Provider opens the conversation from their Messages/Inbox, reads the message; system records read receipt.
8. Provider replies with clarifications or additional information; patient receives notification and sees unread badge in inbox.
9. Patient opens conversation from inbox; sees new message in real time; unread badge clears.
10. System logs all events (sent, delivered, read) to audit trail; conversation remains searchable; admin can monitor with keyword flagging.

### Alternative Flows

**A1: Attachment Flow**:

- **Trigger**: Patient or provider includes attachment (images, videos, or PDFs)
- **Steps**:
  1. System validates file type (JPG/PNG, MP4, or PDF) and size (images max 5MB, video max 10MB, PDF max 10MB).
  2. System validates attachment count (max 5 per message).
  3. If valid, system stores media securely and links it to the message; generates thumbnails for images/videos.
  4. If invalid, system displays specific error message and blocks upload.
- **Outcome**: Valid attachments appear in the thread with preview (images/videos) or download link (PDFs); recipients can view/playback/download.

**A2: Admin Manual Flagging for Observation**:

- **Trigger**: Admin identifies conversation requiring closer monitoring but not immediate intervention (suspicious pattern, borderline language, emerging dispute)
- **Steps**:
  1. Admin reviews conversation and identifies potential concern.
  2. Admin selects "Flag for Observation" action.
  3. System prompts admin to select flag type: "Off-Platform Risk" / "Potential Dispute" / "Quality Concern" / "Follow-Up Needed" / "Other".
  4. Admin optionally adds internal notes (not visible to patient/provider).
  5. System marks conversation with flag badge in admin dashboard.
  6. Flagged conversations appear in admin's "Flagged" filter for easy tracking.
  7. System logs flag action with timestamp, admin user, flag type, and notes.
- **Outcome**: Conversation marked for closer observation; admin can monitor developments; flag history tracked for review; no notification sent to patient/provider.

**A3: Admin Emergency Intervention**:

- **Trigger**: Admin detects CRITICAL situation requiring immediate intervention (serious policy violation, urgent dispute, patient safety emergency)
- **Steps**:
  1. Admin identifies emergency via automatic keyword flag, manual observation flag escalation, or direct detection in Screen 6A (Message Thread Detail - Monitoring).
  2. Admin clicks "Enable Emergency Intervention" button and confirms action; system activates Screen 6B (Emergency Intervention Mode).
  3. Screen 6B displays prominent warning banner: "🚨 EMERGENCY INTERVENTION MODE - Both patient and provider will be notified".
  4. Admin selects mandatory emergency reason (Policy Violation / Urgent Dispute / Patient Safety) and optionally adds internal justification notes.
  5. Admin reviews full conversation context and flag history (still visible in Screen 6B).
  6. Admin composes emergency intervention message clearly addressing both parties (e.g., policy enforcement, dispute mediation, safety guidance).
  7. Admin reviews preview and clicks Send; both patient and provider receive immediate notification.
  8. System marks message with "Hairline Admin" badge in conversation thread (visible to all parties).
  9. System logs emergency intervention with timestamp, admin user, emergency reason, justification notes, and full message content.
  10. If conversation was previously flagged, system updates flag status to "Intervention Completed".
  11. System returns admin to Screen 6A with intervention message visible in thread.
- **Outcome**: Emergency situation addressed; policy enforced; patient/provider receive authoritative guidance; intervention logged for audit and compliance review; conversation state updated.

**B1: Invalid Content**:

- **Trigger**: Attachment exceeds limits or unsupported type
- **Steps**:
  1. System validates attachment before upload.
  2. If invalid, system blocks upload and displays specific error:
     - "Image must be JPG or PNG format, max 5MB"
     - "Video must be MP4 format, max 10MB"
     - "PDF must be max 10MB"
     - "Maximum 5 attachments per message"
  3. User can retry with valid content.
- **Outcome**: Only valid content sent; conversation integrity maintained; clear user guidance provided.

**B2: Intermittent Connectivity**:

- **Trigger**: Network lost during send
- **Steps**:
  1. System queues the message locally and indicates pending state.
  2. On reconnect, system retries; if failure persists, prompts user to resend.
- **Outcome**: Message eventually sent or user notified to retry; no silent loss.

- Emergency intervention used for: serious policy violations, urgent disputes that providers cannot resolve, patient safety emergencies.
- Providers are expected to maintain professional communication standards and not solicit off-platform contact.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- Architecture: Real-time messaging delivery with persistence and audit logging.
- Real-time Transport: WebSocket/Socket.io for text messaging to enable real-time bidirectional communication.
- Audio/Video Calls: Twilio integration for real-time audio and video calls between patients and providers.
- Technology: Media handling supports JPG/PNG images (max 5MB), MP4 videos (max 10MB), and PDF files (max 10MB); client-side validation before upload; background upload for larger files with progress indication.
- Performance: Degrade gracefully on poor connectivity with retries and clear status; optimize video compression on mobile devices.
- Storage: Medical communications retained per compliance with fast retrieval for care contexts; efficient media storage with thumbnail generation for images/videos.
- Admin intervention: Emergency-only mode with mandatory reason tracking and audit logging.

### Integration Points

- Patient app → Messaging service
  - Data format: Structured message payloads with participant IDs and attachment metadata.
  - Authentication: Tenant-authenticated sessions; role-based permissions.
  - Error handling: Retry on transient failures; clear feedback to user.

- Provider web app → Messaging service
  - Data format: Patient conversation queries, message composition, media attachments.
  - Authentication: Provider-authenticated sessions; access scoped to own patients.
  - Error handling: Validation feedback; retry mechanisms; keyword flag warnings.

- Admin dashboard → Messaging service
  - Data format: Read-only conversation monitoring; emergency intervention payloads with mandatory reason.
  - Authentication: Admin roles only; scoped access; emergency intervention permission check.
  - Error handling: Paged results; robust filtering; export fallbacks; intervention logging.

### Scalability Considerations

- Current scale: Expect dozens to hundreds of concurrent conversations at launch.
- Growth projection: 5× growth in 12 months with seasonal peaks.
- Peak load: Handle sudden spikes (campaigns/product launches) without delivery delays.
- Data volume: Growing media attachments; efficient storage and lifecycle management required.
- Scaling strategy: Horizontally scalable messaging and notification services; background processing for heavy tasks.

### Security Considerations

- Authentication: Strong session controls; MFA is a planned mandatory control for Admin/Provider and will be enforced platform-wide once the shared MFA stack (FR-026 / FR-031) is delivered; until then enforce strong passwords, throttling, and re-authentication flows per policy.
- Authorization: Role-based access; least-privilege visibility to conversations.
- Encryption: All content encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256); media links protected.
- Audit trail: Immutable logs of access and message events retained per policy; admin interventions specially flagged.
- Threat mitigation: Abuse prevention on messaging and media uploads; keyword moderation and rate controls; emergency intervention tracking.
- Compliance: Align with GDPR and HIPAA-equivalent standards; data residency honored.
- Admin intervention controls: Mandatory reason tracking; limited to authorized roles; full audit logging; performance monitoring to ensure <5% usage rate.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Patient views inbox and manages conversations (Priority: P1)

A patient receives quotes from 3 providers, opens their Messages/Inbox (Screen 1), sees 3 conversations with unread badges, filters by "Unread", searches for a specific provider by name, and taps a conversation to open the chat.

Why this priority: Core navigation pattern; patients need to manage multiple provider conversations efficiently.

Independent Test: Create 3 provider quotes; verify conversations appear in patient inbox; test filter by unread; test search by provider name; verify conversation opens on tap.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a provider submits a quote, when the quote is submitted, then a new conversation appears in patient's Messages/Inbox (Screen 1) with provider name, unread badge, and timestamp.
2. Given patient has 5 conversations with 2 unread, when patient selects "Unread" filter, then only 2 unread conversations are displayed.
3. Given patient has multiple conversations, when patient types provider name in search, then conversation list filters to matching providers in real-time.
4. Given patient taps a conversation in inbox, when tapped, then full chat view (Screen 2) opens showing conversation history.
5. Given patient has unread messages, when patient opens conversation and reads messages, then unread badge clears in inbox view.

---

### User Story 2 - Patient asks provider about quote (Priority: P1)

A patient receives multiple quotes, opens their Messages/Inbox, sees conversations with providers who sent quotes, opens a specific conversation, has questions about one provider's package options and procedure details, sends a message to the provider, and receives clarification within 24 hours.

Why this priority: Core to quote acceptance and booking conversion; helps patients make informed decisions.

Independent Test: Provider submits quote; verify conversation auto-created in both inboxes; patient opens from inbox; test patient sends message; verify provider receives, responds, and patient sees reply with read receipts and notifications.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a logged-in patient opens their Messages/Inbox and selects a conversation, when they send a valid text message with questions, then the message appears in the thread with sending and sent states in under 1 second.
2. Given provider is notified, when provider opens conversation from their Messages/Inbox and replies within 24 hours, then the patient receives notification and sees unread badge in inbox.
3. Given patient opens conversation with new message, when the message is viewed, then the provider sees a read receipt within 2 seconds and patient's inbox unread badge clears.

---

### User Story 3 - Admin flags conversation for observation (Priority: P1)

Admin reviews conversations, notices a provider using borderline language that could escalate to off-platform solicitation, manually flags conversation as "Off-Platform Risk" for closer monitoring without alerting the parties, and continues to observe.

Why this priority: Proactive monitoring prevents policy violations before they require intervention; enables early detection without disrupting user experience.

Independent Test: Admin reviews conversation with borderline language; selects "Flag for Observation"; chooses "Off-Platform Risk" flag type; adds internal note; verify conversation marked with orange flag in dashboard; verify patient/provider receive no notification; verify flag appears in "Flagged" filter.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given admin is viewing a conversation, when admin selects "Flag for Observation" action, then system prompts for flag type selection.
2. Given admin selects flag type "Off-Platform Risk" and adds note "Provider mentioned 'better pricing outside app'", when admin confirms, then conversation is marked with orange flag badge in admin dashboard.
3. Given conversation is flagged, when admin views conversation list with "Flagged" filter, then flagged conversation appears with flag type indicator.
4. Given conversation is flagged, when admin opens conversation, then flag history panel shows flag type, timestamp, admin user, and internal notes.
5. Given conversation is flagged for observation, when patient or provider opens their messages, then NO indication of flag is visible (silent monitoring).

---

### User Story 4 - Admin emergency intervention for policy violation (Priority: P1)

Admin detects serious off-platform solicitation attempt via keyword flag; admin enables emergency intervention mode, selects reason, and sends policy enforcement message to both patient and provider.

Why this priority: Platform integrity and compliance; prevents revenue loss; protects patients from unauthorized transactions.

Independent Test: Provider sends message with flagged keyword (e.g., "contact me on WhatsApp"); admin receives flag, enables emergency mode, selects "Policy Violation" reason, sends intervention; verify both parties receive admin message with badge.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a provider sends a message containing flagged keyword, when the message is sent, then the system automatically flags the conversation in admin dashboard with keyword badge.
2. Given admin identifies serious policy violation, when admin enables emergency intervention mode and selects "Policy Violation" as reason, then admin can compose and send message.
3. Given admin sends emergency intervention message, when the message is sent, then both patient and provider receive notification and see message with "Hairline Admin" badge.
4. Given admin emergency intervention occurred, when viewing audit log, then intervention is logged with timestamp, admin user, emergency reason ("Policy Violation"), and full message content.

---

### User Story 5 - Provider responds with detailed clarification (Priority: P1)

A provider receives patient question about package options and graft count estimation, attaches facility photos and treatment plan diagram, and provides detailed explanation within 24 hours.

Why this priority: Enhances provider-patient communication; increases quote acceptance rate; builds trust.

Independent Test: Provider receives patient message with questions; attaches media; sends detailed response; verify patient receives with attachments and notifications.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a provider viewing patient conversation, when they compose a response and attach images (facility photos, treatment plans), then the message is sent with attachments within 2 seconds.
2. Given patient receives provider response, when patient opens the message, then attachments are viewable with thumbnails and full-size preview.
3. Given provider response includes multiple attachments, when patient views conversation, then all attachments display inline with proper formatting.

### Edge Cases

- **Excessive attachments**: Enforce 5 attachments max per message; display clear error "Maximum 5 attachments per message" if exceeded.
- **Oversized attachments**: Block upload and show specific error based on type (e.g., "Image must be under 5MB", "Video must be under 10MB", "PDF must be under 10MB").
- **Unsupported file types**: Block upload and show "Only JPG/PNG images (max 5MB), MP4 videos (max 10MB), and PDF files (max 10MB) are allowed."
- **No provider response within 48 hours**: Auto-remind provider; if still no response after 72 hours, system escalates to an admin follow-up queue (e.g., manual observation flag "Follow-Up Needed") and sends additional provider reminders via notifications. Admin messaging remains emergency-only.
- **Account deletion request with open conversations**: Archive conversations; restrict access per policy; admin emergency messages preserved in archive.
- **Simultaneous sends**: Maintain message ordering and idempotency safeguards; admin emergency messages sorted chronologically with patient/provider messages.
- **Provider persistent off-platform solicitation**: Admin intervenes with warning via emergency mode; repeated violations may trigger provider review/suspension.
- **Patient safety emergency during conversation**: Admin can intervene immediately using emergency mode to provide guidance or escalate to medical team.
- **Admin intervention visibility**: Admin emergency messages visible to both patient and provider; cannot be deleted or edited by any party.
- **Manual flag escalation**: Conversation manually flagged for observation escalates to emergency intervention when situation worsens; flag status updated to "Intervention Completed" after intervention.
- **Multiple flags on same conversation**: System handles multiple manual flags (e.g., flagged as "Off-Platform Risk", later flagged as "Potential Dispute"); flag history shows chronological sequence.
- **Flag without action**: Flagged conversations where concern doesn't materialize; admin can mark flag as "Resolved - No Action Needed" without intervention.
- **Multiple conversations per inquiry**: One patient inquiry can generate multiple quotes from different providers, resulting in multiple conversations; admin filters by inquiry ID to view all related conversations for comprehensive case review (e.g., patient disputes pricing across multiple quotes).

- **REQ-012-001**: System MUST automatically create a new conversation between patient and provider when provider submits their **first** quote for patient inquiry; subsequent quotes from same provider to same patient MUST add inquiry/quote IDs to existing conversation (one conversation per patient-provider pair).
- **REQ-012-002**: System MUST provide a Messages Inbox view for patients showing all conversations with filtering (read/unread status), search (provider name, message content), and sorting (latest activity, provider name, date created) capabilities.
- **REQ-012-003**: System MUST provide a Messages popup/submenu in header navigation for providers showing recent conversations (max 10) with unread counts and quick access to patient chats.
- **REQ-012-004**: System MUST provide a Communication Monitoring Center for admins as comprehensive message list with advanced filtering (patient, provider, service type, quote ID, inquiry ID, date range, flag type, conversation status) applied simultaneously.
- **REQ-012-005**: System MUST provide a detailed Message Thread View for admins with two states: Screen 6A (default monitoring/flagging state with read-only access) and Screen 6B (activated emergency intervention state with message composition), accessible when conversation is selected from monitoring center.
- **REQ-012-006**: System MUST enable in-app messaging for Patient ↔ Provider with text and media, accessible ONLY through dedicated Messages/Inbox screens (not through quote detail screens).
- **REQ-012-007**: System MUST deliver real-time notifications for new messages to intended recipients (patients, providers, and both parties when admin intervenes); update unread badges in inbox views and header popup menus.
- **REQ-012-008**: Users MUST be able to view complete conversation history with timestamps and read receipts.
- **REQ-012-009**: System MUST enforce attachment type and size limits (Images: JPG/PNG max 5MB; Video: MP4 max 10MB; PDF: max 10MB; max 5 attachments per message) and provide specific user feedback on violations.
- **REQ-012-010**: System MUST log message lifecycle events (sent, delivered, read) and admin emergency interventions for audit.
- **REQ-012-011**: System MUST allow admins to manually flag conversations for observation with flag type selection (Off-Platform Risk / Potential Dispute / Quality Concern / Follow-Up Needed / Other) and optional internal notes.
- **REQ-012-012**: System MUST distinguish between automatic keyword flags (red) and manual observation flags (orange) in admin monitoring center and thread detail view; flagging must NOT notify patient or provider.
- **REQ-012-013**: System MUST allow admins to send messages in patient-provider conversations ONLY for emergency situations with mandatory reason tracking (Policy Violation / Urgent Dispute / Patient Safety).
- **REQ-012-014**: System MUST clearly identify admin messages with "Hairline Admin" badge visible to both patient and provider.

### Data Requirements

- **REQ-012-015**: System MUST maintain conversations per patient-provider pair with searchable metadata (patient ID, provider ID, inquiry ID, quote reference, status, unread_count, keyword flags, manual observation flags, admin_intervened flag, emergency_reason, last_message_at).
- **REQ-012-016**: System MUST store flag history for each conversation including flag type, timestamp, admin user, status (active/resolved), and internal notes.
- **REQ-012-017**: System MUST store attachments securely with links to their parent messages, access controls, and metadata (file type, size, upload timestamp, thumbnail URLs for images/videos).

### Security & Privacy Requirements

- **REQ-012-018**: System MUST enable patient-provider messaging only when provider has sent a quote to patient.
- **REQ-012-019**: System MUST encrypt all message content and media in transit and at rest and protect access by role.
- **REQ-012-020**: System MUST retain medical communications for at least 7 years and support audit export for compliance.
- **REQ-012-021**: Admin MUST have monitoring access to all patient-provider conversations with manual flagging capability and EMERGENCY-ONLY intervention capability.
- **REQ-012-022**: System MUST maintain patient anonymization (e.g., "Mark P." + ID) until payment confirmation per FR-003.
- **REQ-012-023**: System MUST log all admin actions (manual flags, flag status changes, emergency interventions) with timestamp, admin user, reason/notes, and action type for compliance audit.
- **REQ-012-024**: System MUST restrict admin intervention to authorized admin roles only; track intervention frequency to ensure <5% threshold; manual observation flags can be used more liberally for proactive monitoring.

### Integration Requirements

- **REQ-012-025**: System MUST integrate with Quote Management (FR-004) to automatically create or update conversation when quote is submitted (create new if first quote from provider to patient; add quote/inquiry ID to existing if subsequent); conversation must reference all inquiry IDs (array) for admin filtering and case tracking; conversation appears or updates in both inboxes immediately.
- **REQ-012-026**: System MUST integrate with Notification Service (S-03) to send alerts on message events (including admin emergency interventions to both parties) and update unread badges; manual observation flags must NOT trigger notifications.
- **REQ-012-027**: System MUST integrate with Media Storage Service (S-05) for attachments with secure retrieval.
- **REQ-012-028**: System MUST integrate with Payment Processing (FR-007) to lift patient anonymization upon payment confirmation.

### Marking Unclear Requirements

No unresolved clarifications remain for this scope. Patient ↔ Provider messaging is in scope for V1 with admin emergency-only intervention capability for critical situations.
