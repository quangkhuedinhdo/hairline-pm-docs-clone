## Executive Summary

The Admin Billing & Financial Management module provides Hairline administrators with comprehensive tools to manage the platform's financial operations across all stakeholders (patients, providers, and affiliates). This module centralizes transaction monitoring, provider payout processing, discount code management, multi-currency revenue reporting, and financial reconciliation across the three-tenant architecture.

This module serves as the financial control center for the platform, ensuring timely payments, accurate commission calculations, transparent billing, and complete audit trails for all financial transactions. It enables Hairline to scale its medical tourism operations while maintaining financial integrity and regulatory compliance.

- View and manage all patient billing and payment transactions
- Process provider payouts with automated commission calculations
- Process affiliate billing and commission payouts using commission outputs from FR-018/A-07
- Track discount code usage and financial impact across bookings (creation owned by FR-019/A-06)
- Generate multi-currency financial reports and analytics
- Reconcile payments across multiple Stripe accounts (account configuration owned by FR-029/A-09)
- Monitor outstanding balances and payment schedules
- Audit all financial transactions with complete traceability

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-03)**: Patients initiate payments through booking flow; invoices and receipts generated
- **Provider Platform (PR-05)**: Providers view upcoming payouts, earnings history, and commission structure
- **Admin Platform (A-05)**: Admins manage all financial operations, billing, and reconciliation
- **Shared Services (S-02)**: Payment Processing Service handles Stripe integration and transaction processing

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

**Patient Platform (P-03: Booking & Payment)**:

- Patients make payments (deposit, installments, final payment) through integrated Stripe checkout
- Patients apply discount codes at checkout
- Payment data flows to admin platform for processing and reconciliation
- **[BACKLOG — Future Phase]** In-app invoice history and receipt viewing for patients: not included in the MVP mobile flow. Patients receive invoices via email (PDF) at payment confirmation; in-app access deferred to a future release.

**Provider Platform (PR-05: Financial Management & Reporting)**:

*Stage 1 — Treatment Earnings Tracking (Provider-visible, per case)*:

- Providers view earnings per completed treatment case (booking-level income visibility)
- Providers view commission structure and breakdown per booking
- Providers can see running total of pending earnings yet to be paid out
- All earnings data is read-only (providers cannot modify financial records)

*Stage 2 — Payout Consolidation & Processing (Admin-initiated, Provider-visible summary)*:

- Admin consolidates all eligible treatment earnings into scheduled payouts (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly per provider agreement)
- Providers view their upcoming payout schedule and expected payout amounts
- Providers view payout history (completed payouts with itemised breakdown)
- Providers download invoices for completed payouts (PDF, generated after admin processes payout)

**Admin Platform (A-05: Billing & Financial Reconciliation)**:

- **Patient Billing**: View all patient invoices, payment status, process refunds, manage installment plans
- **Provider Billing**: View provider payment schedules, approve/process payouts, reconcile payments, generate invoices
- **Affiliate Billing**: View affiliate commissions, process monthly payouts, track referral revenue
- **Discount Usage & ROI Tracking**: View discount code usage, financial impact, and ROI across bookings — creation and approval managed in FR-019 / A-06: Discount & Promotion Management
- **Financial Reporting**: Generate revenue analytics, commission breakdowns, outstanding balance reports
- **[Not in scope — see FR-029]** Stripe Account Management: Stripe account configuration, regional account mapping, and currency conversion rate setup are owned by FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration. A-05 consumes the configured Stripe accounts for payout execution.
- **Audit & Compliance**: Complete transaction logs, payment reconciliation, dispute resolution

**Shared Services (S-02: Payment Processing Service)**:

- Stripe API integration for payment processing (charges, refunds, transfers)
- Multi-currency payment support with locked exchange rates
- Installment payment scheduling and automated charging
- Commission calculation engine
- Payment retry logic for failed transactions
- Webhook handling for Stripe events (successful payments, failed charges, disputes)

### Communication Structure

**Billing/payout notification events required by FR-017** (FR-017 is the authoritative source for billing events; FR-020 / S-03 handles delivery, channels, and user preferences):

| Event | Recipients | Channel (MVP) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payment received / receipt | Patient, Provider (optional), Admin (optional) | Email + Push | Triggered on successful Stripe payment |
| Payment failed | Patient, Admin (optional) | Email + Push | Triggered on failed charge or webhook |
| Payment due reminder (installment / balance) | Patient | Email + Push | Sent 3 days before due date |
| Provider payout processed | Provider, Admin (optional) | Email + Push | Sent after admin confirms payout |
| Affiliate payout processed | Affiliate, Admin (optional) | Email + Push | Sent after monthly affiliate payout |
| Payout failed | Admin (primary), Provider (optional), Affiliate (optional) | Email + Push | Triggered on failed Stripe transfer |
| Outstanding invoice alert | Admin | Email + Push | Internal alert for overdue patient invoices (configurable threshold) |
| Overdue payout alert | Admin | Email + Push | Triggered on payout day when a statement was not approved during the buffer window and was skipped by auto-processing |

**Channels**: Email and in-app push (notification dropdown) for both admin and provider platforms. SMS is deferred to a future phase.

**Admin & Provider notification access**: Both admin and provider have an in-app **notification dropdown** (infinite scroll) in their respective dashboards for push notifications. Admin notification preferences are configurable via FR-030; provider preferences are managed in FR-032 / PR-06.

**Out of Scope**:

- SMS notifications for payment events — **not available in MVP**
- In-app chat for payment disputes (handled by FR-034 / A-10: Support Center & Ticketing)
- Provider-patient direct communication about payments (routed through admin support)
- **In-app invoice history for patients** — **BACKLOG (Future Phase)**: Patient invoice and receipt access within the mobile app is not in MVP scope. Patients receive invoices via email only at this stage.

### Entry Points

**Admin Access**:

- Admin logs into Admin Platform → navigates to "Billing & Finance" section
- Dashboard displays: upcoming payouts, outstanding patient invoices, pending provider payments, affiliate commissions due

**Automated Triggers**:

- Treatment completion triggers provider payout eligibility calculation; eligible earnings are immediately added to the provider's running earnings total
- Scheduled cron job runs daily (e.g., 3 AM UTC) to check each active provider's individual payout schedule (configured in FR-015 / A-02 — Commission & Financials tab); for each provider whose buffer window starts on that day, the system generates a payout statement with status "Pending Approval"; admin notified to review and approve newly generated statements
- Scheduled cron job on payout day (e.g., Friday at 6 AM UTC) auto-processes all statements with status "Approved" — no admin action required on payout day; statements still in "Pending Approval" are marked "Overdue" and admin is notified
- Scheduled cron jobs check for upcoming installment payments (daily at 3 AM UTC)
- Scheduled cron jobs generate monthly affiliate payout summaries at the start of the buffer period before the monthly payout date
- Stripe webhook events (`transfer.created`, `transfer.paid`, `transfer.failed`) trigger real-time payout status updates
- Failed payment events trigger admin alerts and retry mechanisms

**Provider Access**:

- Provider logs into Provider Platform → navigates to "Financial Management" section
- Stage 1 (earnings tracking): Provider sees per-treatment earnings accumulate in real time as treatments complete — this is always visible
- Stage 2 (payout visibility): Provider sees a confirmed payout entry ONLY after admin has approved the payout statement and the Stripe transfer is initiated — providers do NOT see draft statements during the buffer review window
- Providers download invoice PDFs after a payout is fully confirmed (Stripe transfer complete)

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Provider Payout Processing

**Actors**: Admin, Provider, System (Payment Processing Service), Stripe
**Trigger**: System auto-generates payout statement at start of buffer period; admin reviews and approves during the buffer window; system auto-processes on payout day
**Outcome**: Provider receives payout; invoice generated and sent; transaction logged

### Alternative Flows

**A1: Bulk Payout Processing (Multiple Providers)**

- **Trigger**: Admin wants to approve all pending statements at once rather than one by one
- **Outcome**: Batch of payouts approved and queued; failed transactions flagged individually for retry

```

**B1: Provider Disputes Payout Amount**

- **Trigger**: Provider claims missing booking revenue in their payout calculation
- **Outcome**: Dispute resolved — either booking is confirmed as paid or added to next payout; provider notified; audit trail updated
- **Flow Diagram**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  B2S1["1. Provider contacts admin via support ticket — claims missing booking revenue in payout"] --> B2S2["2. Admin searches disputed Booking Reference in A-05 transaction history"]

## Screen Specifications

> **Tenant scope**:
>
> - **Admin Platform (A-05)**: Screens 1–8 below. Core billing management for providers, patients, affiliates, financial reporting, investigation, and audit workflows.
> - **Provider Platform (PR-05)**: Screens 9–10 below. Provider-facing read-only views for earnings tracking (Stage 1) and confirmed payout history (Stage 2). FR-017 defines the screen specs since it owns the financial data model; FR-032 provides the provider dashboard navigation shell.
> - **Patient Platform**: No patient-facing billing screens in this FR. Patient payment initiation (deposit, installments, final payment) is owned by FR-007: Payment Processing. Patient-facing invoice history is **[BACKLOG — Future Phase]**.
> - **Affiliate Platform**: No affiliate-facing screens in this FR. Affiliates view their commission earnings via a read-only dashboard in FR-018 (A-07: Affiliate Program Management). FR-017 Screen 6 is the admin-side view for processing affiliate payouts only.

---

### Admin Platform Screens (A-05)

**Role-Based Action Visibility**:

- **Billing Admin** and **Super Admin** can view all admin financial screens and execute payout approvals, retries, refunds, overrides, and bulk actions
- **Billing Viewer** can access the same screens in read-only mode, but selection checkboxes, money-moving buttons, retry buttons, override buttons, and confirmation modals are hidden
- Any action that moves money or changes a financial status MUST invoke the financial re-authentication step before the final confirm action is enabled

**Business Rules**:

- Payout MUST include ALL treatments with status "Completed" or "Aftercare" within the payout period
- Payout period determined by provider's payment schedule (read from FR-015 / A-02):
  - **Weekly**: Monday to Sunday of the preceding week
  - **2x a Month**: Either 1st–15th or 16th–last day of the preceding month period
  - **Monthly**: Full preceding calendar month
- The commission model/value for each included booking comes from the booking-time snapshot: provider-specific commission configuration managed in FR-015 / A-02 or FR-029 / A-09 when defined, otherwise the FR-029 / A-09 global default
- If provider commission model is Percentage, the percentage calculation is applied AFTER currency conversion (if applicable)
- If provider commission model is Flat Rate, the configured fixed deduction from FR-015 / A-02 is applied per completed procedure included in the payout
- Exchange rates locked at time of patient booking acceptance (no fluctuation risk to provider during payout)
- If a patient refund is processed AFTER the provider has already been paid, the next provider payout statement MUST include a row in `Payout Adjustments` labelled `Adjustment: Refund deducted — [Booking Reference] — [Date]`
- If a refund deduction exceeds the provider's current payout amount, the unapplied balance remains visible in `Remaining Balance` and carries forward to the next payout cycle until fully recovered
- Internal notes visible ONLY to admins (never exposed to provider)
- "Approve Payout" is enabled ONLY when Payout Readiness = "Ready", the user role is Billing Admin or Super Admin, and financial re-authentication succeeds
- "Approve Payout" button marks the statement as "Approved" and queues it for the payout-day cron; Stripe transfer is not initiated during the buffer review action
- On payout day, the cron initiates Stripe transfer for all statements already in "Approved" status; status changes to "Processing" → "Paid" after Stripe confirmation webhook
- Stripe Transfer ID remains blank until Stripe confirms `transfer.created`; failure reason remains blank unless Stripe or validation returns a blocking error

**Batch Approval Confirmation Modal** (appears when admin clicks "Approve All Selected Payouts" in Screen 2):

| Confirm button | "Yes, Approve All" — marks all selected statements as "Approved" sequentially; displays live progress: "Approving X of Y statements..." |
| Cancel button | "No, Cancel" — returns to list with no changes |

| Re-authentication | Password re-entry field in MVP. After FR-026 / FR-031 shared MFA rollout, this is replaced by MFA challenge verification |
| Confirm button | "Yes, Approve" — marks statement "Approved". Enabled ONLY after successful re-authentication |
| Cancel button | "No, Cancel" — returns to payout detail without change |

**Retry Payout Confirmation Modal** (appears when admin retries a failed payout):

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Summary line | "Retry payout of [Net Payout amount] to [Provider Name]?" |
| Failure context | Shows prior failure reason and the current payout readiness state |
| Destination | "Bank account ending in [last 4 digits]" |
| Re-authentication | Password re-entry field in MVP; MFA challenge after shared MFA rollout |

- Provide "Download Detailed Report" button to export payout breakdown as PDF for provider records
- Highlight any bookings with special conditions (refunds, partial payments) with warning icon

| Installment Plan | badge | No | Installment progress with retry indicator (if applicable): "2/5 installments paid" or "2/5 — Retry 2/3 in progress" if a payment is currently in retry | Display format |
| Actions | buttons | Yes | "View Details", "Send Reminder", "Process Refund", "Download Invoice", "Override Status" | Conditional |

**Send Reminder Confirmation Modal** (appears when admin clicks "Send Reminder" on Screen 4 or Screen 4a):

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Summary line | "Send payment reminder to [Patient Name]?" |
| Invoice reference | Invoice Number and Outstanding Balance shown for context |
| Reminder Type | Auto-selected based on invoice status: "Upcoming Due Reminder" (Pending), "Overdue Reminder" (Overdue), "At Risk — Final Notice" (At Risk). Display-only; not editable by admin |
| Channel | "Via: Email + Push Notification" — display only |
| Confirm button | "Yes, Send Reminder" — triggers FR-020 notification event; creates entry in Reminder History |
| Cancel button | "No, Cancel" — dismisses modal with no action |

**Business Rules** (Send Reminder):

- Reminder content and template are determined by FR-020 / S-03 based on the reminder type; admin cannot customize the message text
- On confirm: FR-020 notification event is triggered; Reminder History table on Screen 4a is updated with: type, channel, sent timestamp, delivery status
- Admin sees a success toast: "Reminder sent to [Patient Name]" (or an error toast if FR-020 returns a failure)
- Sending a manual reminder does NOT reset or interfere with any automated reminder schedule

**Business Rules**:

- Invoice generated automatically when patient completes booking payment (deposit or full)
- Invoices with installment plans display: "X of Y installments paid"
- "Overdue" status triggered if outstanding balance remains 7 days after due date
- **"At Risk" status** triggered when all 3 retry attempts for any installment have failed; booking is flagged for admin review. Admin MUST manually follow up with patient (contact via support, update payment method, or cancel booking)
- "Send Reminder" button available ONLY for invoices with status "Pending", "Overdue", or "At Risk"
- "Process Refund" button available ONLY for invoices with status "Paid" or "Partial"
- Refunds require admin to enter mandatory reason (max 500 characters) and follow cancellation policy (FR-006: Booking & Scheduling); see Screen 4b: Refund Confirmation Modal
- Clicking "Download Invoice" generates PDF with Hairline branding, itemized breakdown, and payment instructions
- Clicking "View Details" opens Screen 4a: Patient Invoice Detail
- **Manual Payment Status Override**: Admin can manually override a payment status when the Stripe webhook fails, is delayed, or when an off-system payment adjustment is needed
  - "Override Status" button available for ANY invoice (all statuses)
  - On click: admin selects new status from dropdown ("Pending", "Partial", "Paid", "Overdue", "Refunded", "At Risk"), enters mandatory reason (free text, max 500 characters), and confirms
  - Override is logged to audit trail with: admin ID, timestamp, previous status, new status, reason entered
  - Overridden invoices display a warning badge: "Status manually adjusted — [date]" visible to admins only
  - Override does NOT automatically trigger Stripe refund or charge — admin is responsible for ensuring any off-system action is completed separately
  - "Override Status" REQUIRES financial re-authentication (password re-entry in MVP; MFA challenge after FR-026 / FR-031) before the Confirm button is enabled — consistent with the module-level RBAC rule that all actions changing a financial status require re-authentication

**Notes**:

- Implement advanced filtering: date range, payment status, currency, installment vs. full payment, patient name/ID
- Support bulk actions: "Send reminders to all overdue invoices", "Export selected invoices to CSV"
- Display warning icon for installments with upcoming payment dates (within 7 days)
- "At Risk" invoices surfaced at top of list in a dedicated section, similar to Overdue pattern in Screen 2

- Clicking "View Details" opens the Referral Booking Sub-Table above
- "Download Report" generates PDF summary for affiliate records (includes per-booking breakdown)
- Support bulk payout processing for all affiliates due on the same date
- Support filtering by payout month/period and affiliate name/ID within each tab

---

#### Screen 9: Provider Earnings Tracker (Stage 1 — Treatment Income)

**Purpose**: Provider view of all per-treatment earnings as treatments complete. Shows each treatment case as an individual income record with a running total of pending earnings awaiting the next payout.

| Currency | text | Yes | Treatment currency | Display: GBP, USD, TRY |
| Treatment Status | badge | Yes | "Completed" or "Aftercare" | Color-coded |
| Payout Status | badge | Yes | "Pending Next Payout", "Included in Payout — [Date]", or "Payout Failed — [Date]" | Display only |

**Summary Bar** (above the treatment list):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Total Pending Earnings | Sum of net earnings for all treatments with Payout Status "Pending Next Payout" |

- Each row is directly linked to its treatment case via Booking Reference (→ FR-001 booking record / A-01 Patient Management)
- Earnings update in real time as treatment status changes
- Provider cannot see the payout statement, buffer window status, or admin approval action
- Once admin approves and Stripe transfer is initiated, affected treatments update to Payout Status "Included in Payout — [Date]"
- If the Stripe transfer fails (`transfer.failed` webhook), affected treatments update to Payout Status "Payout Failed — [Date]" and display a warning icon. They revert to "Pending Next Payout" once the admin retries and the transfer succeeds
- **Refunded treatments**: If a patient refund is processed on a booking that had not yet been paid out, the treatment row is updated to show Net Earning as £0.00 with a "Refunded" label and a strikethrough on the original amount. The treatment is excluded from the Total Pending Earnings calculation. If the refund is partial (e.g., only add-on packages refunded), Net Earning is recalculated based on the adjusted booking amount
- If a patient refund is processed AFTER the provider has already been paid, the original treatment row remains visible with Adjustment Marker "Refunded — Deducted from Next Payout" and Net Earning showing the negative deduction amount clearly; if the deduction spans multiple cycles, the tooltip explains the remaining carry-forward balance
- Adjustment Marker opens a provider-friendly explanation tooltip (e.g., "Adjusted due to partial refund on 12-04-2026"); no internal admin notes are exposed
- Treatments are never removed from this list; older entries remain visible for historical reference

**Notes**:

- Support filtering by: treatment status, payout status, date range

## Business Rules

### General Module Rules

- **Rule 1**: All financial transactions MUST be logged with timestamp, admin user ID, transaction amount, and affected parties (patient/provider/affiliate)
- **Rule 2**: Every payment record (patient invoice, provider payout, affiliate commission) MUST maintain a traceable link to the treatment case(s) that generated it via Booking Reference. This traceability is required for audit, dispute resolution, and commission verification. Patient invoices link 1:1 to a booking; provider payouts and affiliate commissions link 1:N to the bookings included in the payout/commission period.
- **Rule 3**: All payment processing MUST use Stripe API (PCI-DSS compliant); NO direct credit card storage
- **Rule 4**: Currency exchange rates locked at time of patient booking acceptance; NO rate changes during payout cycle. USD is the base currency — all conversions route through USD (e.g., GBP→USD→TRY; no direct non-USD pair rates). The list of supported currency pairs is dynamic and admin-configurable in FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration. FR-017 supports any currency pair that is enabled in FR-029; it does not restrict or define which pairs are available.
- **Rule 5**: Provider payouts processed ONLY after treatment status changes to "Completed" or "Aftercare"
- **Rule 6**: Installment payments MUST complete by the cutoff date before scheduled treatment (cutoff days configured in FR-029 / A-09; default: 30 days). See FR-007B: Split Payment / Installment Plans.
- **Rule 7**: Refunds follow graduated cancellation policy (FR-006: Booking & Scheduling): >30 days = 90%, 15-30 days = 50%, <15 days = 0%
- **Rule 8**: **[Not in scope — see FR-019]** Discount code expiration and lifecycle rules (including the requirement for expiration dates) are defined and enforced in FR-019 / A-06: Discount & Promotion Management
- **Rule 9**: **[Not in scope — see FR-019]** Provider approval workflow for both-fees discounts is defined in FR-019 / A-06: Discount & Promotion Management
- **Rule 10**: Affiliate commissions calculated ONLY on net revenue (after discounts and refunds)
- **Rule 11**: Multi-currency bookings display amounts in patient's selected currency; providers receive payouts in their configured currency

### Data & Privacy Rules

- **Privacy Rule 1**: Patient full names and contact details visible in financial records ONLY after booking payment confirmation
- **Privacy Rule 2**: Provider bank account details masked in UI (show last 4 digits only); full details stored encrypted at rest
- **Privacy Rule 3**: Financial transaction logs MUST include masked payment method (e.g., "Visa ending in 1234") NOT full card numbers
- **Audit Rule**: All admin actions in financial module MUST be logged with admin ID, timestamp, action type, and affected records
- **Data Retention**: Financial transaction records MUST be retained for minimum 7 years (healthcare and tax compliance)
- **GDPR/Compliance**: Patient data deletion requests MUST result in PII anonymization while preserving financial records for audit (replace name with "Patient #ID")

### Admin Editability Rules

**Editable by Admin**:

- **[Not in scope — see FR-015/A-02]** Per-provider payout frequency (Weekly, 2x a Month, or Monthly): configured per provider via the Commission & Financials tab in Provider Management; FR-017 reads this setting per provider to determine individual statement generation timing
- **[Not in scope — see FR-019]** Discount code creation, activation, deactivation, and expiration dates: managed in FR-019 / A-06
- **[Not in scope — see FR-019]** Discount maximum usage limits: managed in FR-019 / A-06
- **[Not in scope — see FR-015/A-02 and FR-029]** Provider commission configuration (Percentage or Flat Rate): managed through the provider profile in FR-015 and surfaced centrally in FR-029 for global / provider-scope commission administration; A-05 reads the booking-time snapshot for payout calculations
- **[Not in scope — see FR-029]** Installment cutoff days (default: 30 days before treatment date): configured in FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration; FR-017 reads this value at runtime to determine installment eligibility
- **[Not in scope — see FR-029]** Currency conversion markup percentage: configured in FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration
- **[Not in scope — see FR-029]** Payout buffer window (days before payout date that statement is auto-generated, default: 3 days): configured in FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration
- **[Not in scope — see FR-030]** Payment reminder schedule: notification timing configured in FR-030 (Notification Rules & Configuration); A-05 triggers the events that S-03 dispatches
- Payout statement approval during buffer/overdue review windows; payout processing is automatic on payout day for approved statements and immediate only when an overdue statement is approved after the normal payout day
- Manual payment status override (with mandatory reason and audit trail — see Screen 4)
- Internal notes on payouts and invoices (admin-only visibility)
- Refund initiation and approval (subject to cancellation policy)

**Fixed in Codebase (Not Editable)**:

- Commission calculation formulas (Percentage and Flat Rate) are fixed in business logic; the active model/value comes from the effective provider commission configuration resolved from FR-015 / A-02 and FR-029 / A-09
- Currency exchange API source (xe.com or equivalent — configured in environment variables); USD is the fixed base currency; supported currency pairs are dynamically configurable in FR-029 / A-09
- Stripe account connection parameters (API keys managed via secrets vault)
- Invoice PDF template structure (branding and layout fixed)
- Audit log retention period (7 years - compliance requirement)
- Payment retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff - hardcoded)

**Configurable with Restrictions**:

- Admin can manually adjust payout amounts ONLY with documented justification (audit trail required)
- Admin can override discount approval ONLY for "Hairline Only" discounts (cannot force provider participation)
- Admin can process refunds ONLY with a mandatory reason entered (free text, max 500 characters) and full audit trail logged; no secondary approver required

### Payment & Billing Rules

- **Payment Rule 1**: Patient deposits (20-30% of total) REQUIRED for booking confirmation; held until treatment completion
- **Payment Rule 2**: Final payment due 7 days before treatment date OR last installment 30 days before treatment (whichever is configured)
- **Payment Rule 3**: Failed installment payments trigger 3 automatic retry attempts (day 1, day 3, day 7); if all fail, booking flagged for admin review
- **Billing Rule 1**: Patient invoices generated immediately upon successful payment (deposit, installment, or final)
- **Billing Rule 2**: Provider payout statements (dashboard view) are auto-generated at the start of the buffer window before each scheduled payout date. Provider invoice PDFs are generated separately only after the Stripe transfer is confirmed (post-payout). Statements and invoices are two distinct artefacts.
- **Billing Rule 3**: Affiliate invoices generated at the start of the buffer window before the monthly payout date (1st processing date minus buffer days)
- **Billing Rule 4**: The buffer window is configurable globally (default: 3 days before payout date). For example, a Friday payout with a 3-day buffer means the statement is generated on Tuesday. Buffer window configuration is managed in FR-029 / A-09: Payment System Configuration.
- **Billing Rule 5**: Admin must approve payout statements during the buffer window. On payout day, the system auto-processes only "Approved" statements. Any statement still in "Pending Approval" at that point moves to "Overdue" and is NOT auto-processed. Overdue statements can be approved and processed at any time outside the normal cycle; the Stripe transfer is initiated immediately on approval. Delay is recorded in the audit trail.
- **Currency Rule 1**: Patients charged in their selected currency; providers paid in their configured currency; Hairline absorbs currency conversion costs
- **Currency Rule 2**: Exchange rates locked at booking acceptance; NO fluctuation risk to patient or provider during booking lifecycle
- **Commission Rule 1**: Platform commission calculated AFTER discount application and BEFORE provider payout
- **Commission Rule 2**: Affiliate commissions deducted from Hairline's commission (does not reduce provider payout)

  - **Why needed**: Provider-specific commission settings and payout frequency are configurable in the admin-managed provider profile
  - **Integration point**: A-02 provides the single-provider commission-management surface plus payout frequency; A-05 reads those values as part of the effective commission configuration resolved for a provider

- **FR-019 / Module A-06: Discount & Promotion Management**
  - **Why needed**: Discount codes created in A-06 affect invoice amounts and commission calculations
  - **Integration point**: A-06 manages discount code creation and approval; A-05 tracks discount usage and financial impact

- **FR-020 / Module S-03: Notification Service**
  - **Why needed**: Email notifications for payment confirmations, payout notifications, payment reminders
  - **Integration point**: A-05 triggers notification events (payment success, payout processed, installment due); S-03 sends emails

- **FR-018 / Module A-07: Affiliate Program Management**
  - **Why needed**: Affiliate commission calculation, referral tracking, and commission rate agreements are owned by FR-018; A-05 owns affiliate billing and payout execution based on these values
  - **Integration point**: A-05 reads affiliate commission amounts calculated in FR-018 for billing and payout execution (Screen 6); commission disputes resolved in FR-018 before payout processing in A-05

- **FR-029 / Module A-09: Payment System Configuration**
  - **Why needed**: Stripe account configuration, currency conversion pair setup, markup percentages, payout buffer window, deposit rates, the global commission default, and the central provider-scope commission screen are all owned by FR-029
  - **Integration point**: A-05 consumes configured Stripe accounts for payout execution, reads currency pairs and rates for multi-currency calculations, reads the FR-029 system default currency to initialize Screen 1 reporting filters, reads the payout buffer window to determine statement auto-generation timing, and consumes the effective commission snapshot resolved from FR-029 global/provider-scope settings plus any single-provider edits made in FR-015

- **FR-030 / Module A-09: Notification Rules & Configuration**
  - **Why needed**: Payment reminder schedules and notification preferences are configured in FR-030
  - **Integration point**: A-05 triggers billing notification events; FR-030 configures timing, channels, and admin preferences for those events

- **FR-032 / Module PR-06: Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management**
  - **Why needed**: Provider dashboard navigation shell hosts FR-017 provider-facing screens; provider payout destination details are managed in FR-032
  - **Integration point**: Screens 9–10 are rendered within the FR-032 provider dashboard shell; bank account details entered and validated in FR-032 Billing Settings are consumed by A-05 for payout execution

### External Dependencies (APIs, Services)

- **External Service 1: Stripe Payment API**
  - **Purpose**: Process credit card payments, bank transfers, refunds; manage connected accounts for provider payouts
  - **Integration**: RESTful API calls for payment intents, transfers, refunds; webhooks for real-time event notifications
  - **Failure handling**: Retry failed transactions with exponential backoff (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours); flag for manual review after 3 failures

- **External Service 2: Currency Exchange API (xe.com or equivalent)**
  - **Purpose**: Fetch real-time currency conversion rates for multi-currency bookings and payouts
  - **Integration**: RESTful API calls (hourly) to retrieve exchange rates; cache rates for 1 hour
  - **Failure handling**: If API unavailable, use last cached rate; flag admin if cache >24 hours stale

- **External Service 3: PDF Generation Library (e.g., wkhtmltopdf, LaTeX, or SaaS like PDFShift)**
  - **Purpose**: Generate invoice PDFs with Hairline branding and itemized breakdowns
  - **Integration**: Server-side PDF rendering from HTML templates
  - **Failure handling**: If PDF generation fails, provide HTML invoice via email; retry PDF generation asynchronously

### Data Dependencies

- **Entity 1: Booking Records (from P-03: Booking & Payment)**
  - **Why needed**: Invoices link to bookings; payout calculations aggregate completed bookings
  - **Source**: Booking module creates booking records upon quote acceptance; financial module consumes booking data

- **Entity 2: Treatment Completion Status (from PR-03: Treatment Execution & Documentation)**
  - **Why needed**: Provider payouts released ONLY after treatment marked "Completed" or "Aftercare"
  - **Source**: Provider platform updates treatment status; financial module monitors status changes

- **Entity 3: Provider Commission Structure (from A-02: Provider Management & Onboarding)**
  - **Why needed**: Commission model/value determines platform revenue and provider payout split
  - **Source**: Configured during provider onboarding and stored in provider profile

- **Entity 4: Discount Code Data (from A-06: Discount & Promotion Management)**
  - **Why needed**: Discount codes affect invoice amounts, commission calculations, and affiliate attribution
  - **Source**: Discount codes created in A-06; applied at checkout; tracked in A-05 for financial reporting

- **Entity 5: Payment Method Tokens (from Stripe)**
  - **Why needed**: Installment payments require stored payment methods for recurring charges
  - **Source**: Payment methods tokenized during initial payment; tokens stored in Stripe (not in Hairline database)

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Admins approve provider payout statements during the scheduled buffer/overdue review windows; in MVP, the system auto-processes approved statements on payout day
- **Assumption 2**: Providers check payment status weekly via provider platform; no daily monitoring expected
- **Assumption 3**: Patients review invoices primarily via email (PDF attachments); in-app invoice access is secondary
- **Assumption 4**: Affiliates accept monthly payout schedule; no demand for more frequent payouts

### Technology Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Stripe API availability: 99.9% uptime; rare outages handled via retry mechanisms
- **Assumption 2**: Currency exchange API updates hourly; rates stable enough for 1-hour caching without significant risk
- **Assumption 3**: Admin platform accessed via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions); no IE11 support
- **Assumption 4**: PDF generation completes within 10 seconds for invoices with <50 line items
- **Assumption 5**: Financial reports covering 12 months of data can be generated within 30 seconds (database optimized with indexes)

### Business Process Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Provider bank account validation is completed in FR-032 Billing Settings before payout processing; no additional per-payout re-verification is required beyond readiness checks
- **Assumption 2**: **[Not in scope — see FR-019]** Discount code approval workflow timing: defined as an assumption in FR-019 / A-06
- **Assumption 3**: Affiliate commission rates remain constant for 12-month contract periods; no mid-cycle rate changes
- **Assumption 4**: Refund requests reviewed manually by admin; no automated refund approvals (fraud prevention)
- **Assumption 5**: Currency conversion costs absorbed by platform; no pass-through to patients or providers
- **Assumption 6**: Payment disputes rare (<1% of transactions); manual resolution acceptable for MVP
- **Assumption 7**: MVP uses database transaction logs for financial audit requirements; the centralized Audit Log Service (S-06) defined in the constitution will be integrated when available, at which point A-05 audit events will be routed through S-06 for immutable, centralized storage

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Financial module requires high data integrity; use database transactions (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) for all payment processing
- **Concurrency**: Prevent race conditions in payout processing; use row-level locking when calculating provider earnings
- **Idempotency**: All Stripe API calls MUST be idempotent (unique idempotency keys per transaction to prevent duplicate charges/transfers)
- **Async Processing**: Use job queues (Redis Queue, AWS SQS) for background tasks: invoice PDF generation, payment retries, payout processing
- **Caching**: Cache currency exchange rates for 1 hour; cache financial dashboard data for 5 minutes (balance between freshness and performance)
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error logging for Stripe API failures; categorize errors (retryable vs. permanent) for appropriate handling
- **Decimal Precision**: Use DECIMAL(19,4) for currency amounts to prevent floating-point rounding errors (critical for financial calculations)

### Integration Points

- **[Not in scope — see FR-007]** Stripe Payment Intents API (patient charges, deposits, installments): integration is owned by FR-007 / Payment Processing. A-05 consumes payment completion events but does not initiate payment intents.

- **Integration 1: Stripe Transfers API (Provider & Affiliate Payouts)**
  - **Purpose**: Initiate payouts to provider connected accounts and affiliate bank accounts after admin approval
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with destination (provider/affiliate connected account ID), amount, currency, metadata (booking IDs, payout period)
  - **Authentication**: Stripe secret API key with `transfer_funds` permission (stored in secrets vault)
  - **Error handling**: Retry failed transfers up to 3 times; flag for manual review and trigger `payout.failed` event if all retries fail

- **[Not in scope — see FR-007]** Stripe Webhooks for payment events (`payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.failed`, `charge.refunded`): owned by FR-007. A-05 consumes payout-specific webhooks only:
  - `transfer.created` — confirms payout initiated; update status "Pending" → "Processing"
  - `transfer.paid` — confirms provider/affiliate received funds; update status "Processing" → "Paid"
  - `transfer.failed` — trigger retry logic and `payout.failed` notification event

- **Integration 2: Currency Exchange API**
  - **Data format**: JSON response with exchange rates for supported currency pairs
  - **Authentication**: API key (if required)
  - **Error handling**: Use cached rates if API unavailable; alert admin if cache >24 hours stale

- **Integration 3: Provider Platform Read-Only API (REQ-017-027)**
  - **Data format**: Provider platform queries payout history and earnings analytics via authenticated REST API exposed by A-05 (see REQ-017-027). No direct database access across tenant boundaries per Constitution Principle I.
  - **Authentication**: Provider session tokens validated against shared auth service; API endpoints enforce RBAC (read-only for providers)
  - **Error handling**: Graceful degradation if API temporarily unavailable; display cached data with staleness warning

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current scale**: Expected 500 bookings per month at launch; 50 providers; 10 affiliates
- **Growth projection**: 5,000 bookings per month within 12 months; 500 providers; 100 affiliates
- **Peak load**: End-of-month provider payouts (500 payouts processed within 4-hour window)
- **Data volume**: 60,000 invoices per year; 6,000 provider payout records per year
- **Scaling strategy**:
  - Horizontal scaling: Add API servers behind load balancer for admin platform
  - Database optimization: Partition financial transaction tables by year; index on frequently queried columns (booking_id, provider_id, payment_date)
  - Batch processing: Process provider payouts in batches of 50 to prevent API rate limiting
  - Caching: Implement Redis caching for financial dashboard queries (5-minute TTL)

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: In MVP, require admin password re-authentication for financial operations (payout approvals, refunds). Once the shared MFA stack from FR-026 / FR-031 is delivered, these actions MUST require MFA-based re-authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions:
  - **Billing Admin**: Full access (view, approve payouts, process refunds with mandatory reason)
  - **Billing Viewer**: Read-only access (cannot approve payouts or refunds)
  - **Super Admin**: Full access, identical refund flow to Billing Admin
- **Encryption**: Encrypt provider bank account details at rest using AES-256; decrypt only during payout processing
- **Audit trail**: Log ALL financial actions with admin ID, timestamp, IP address, action type, before/after values
- **Fraud prevention**:
  - Flag sudden high-value discount codes for review (>50% off or >£500)
  - Flag provider payouts exceeding 2x average payout amount for manual review
  - Implement rate limiting on refund API endpoints (max 10 refunds per admin per hour)
- **PCI-DSS Compliance**: NO credit card data stored in Hairline database; all payment data handled by Stripe (PCI-compliant processor)
- **Data retention**: Financial records retained for 7 years (compliance requirement); soft-delete only (no hard deletes)
- **Sensitive data masking**: Mask payment methods in UI (show "Visa ending in 1234" not full card number)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Weekly Provider Payout Processing (Priority: P1)

An admin processes weekly provider payouts every Friday for providers who have completed treatments in the past 7 days, ensuring timely payments and accurate commission calculations.

**Why this priority**: Core financial operation; providers depend on regular payouts for cash flow; delays damage provider relationships and platform reputation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating completed bookings for multiple providers, navigating to "Provider Billing" → "Upcoming Payments", selecting providers, and processing payouts. Verify Stripe transfer initiated, provider notified, and invoice generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin is logged into Admin Platform AND navigates to "Provider Billing" → "Upcoming Payments"
   **When** admin filters by "Payment Schedule: Weekly" AND views list of providers with earnings
   **Then** system displays all providers with completed treatments in past 7 days, showing: provider name, outstanding earnings, commission %, net payout, bank account last 4 digits

2. **Given** admin selects a provider from "Upcoming Payments" list AND clicks "View Details"
   **When** payout detail modal opens
   **Then** system displays itemized breakdown: treatment list (booking IDs, patient names, treatment dates, amounts), total revenue, commission amount, net payout, bank account details

3. **Given** admin reviews payout details AND clicks "Approve Payout" AND confirms payout amount during the buffer window
   **When** system records the approval
   **Then** payout status changes to "Approved", no Stripe transfer is initiated yet, and the statement is queued for the scheduled payout day

4. **Given** payout day arrives AND the statement status is "Approved"
   **When** the payout-day cron runs and Stripe transfer completes successfully (webhook received)
   **Then** payout status updates from "Processing" to "Paid", invoice PDF generated, email sent to provider with invoice attachment, transaction logged in audit trail

5. **Given** multiple providers (10+) have payouts due on same date
   **When** admin uses "Select All" AND clicks "Approve All Selected Payouts"
   **Then** system approves statements in batch, displays progress indicator, queues all successful approvals for payout-day auto-processing, and flags any failures for manual review

---

### User Story 2 - Patient Installment Payment Management (Priority: P1)

Patients book treatments with split payment plans (2-9 monthly installments), and the system automatically charges installments on schedule, sends reminders, and handles failed payments.

**Why this priority**: Installment plans increase booking conversion by 40%; critical for affordability and patient acquisition; automated processing reduces admin workload.

**Independent Test**: Create booking with 5-month installment plan, advance system date to trigger installment charges, verify automatic charging, reminders sent, and failed payment retries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** patient accepts quote AND selects "Split Payment: 5 months" at checkout
   **When** patient completes first installment payment
   **Then** system calculates remaining 4 installments (equal amounts), schedules charges for days 30, 60, 90, 120, generates invoice with installment schedule, confirms booking

2. **Given** installment payment due in 3 days
   **When** scheduled reminder job runs daily at 9 AM
   **Then** system sends email reminder to patient: "Your next payment of £XXX is due on [date]. Your card ending in 1234 will be charged automatically."

3. **Given** installment payment due date arrives
   **When** scheduled charge job runs at 12 AM (midnight)
   **Then** system charges patient's stored payment method via Stripe, generates receipt, sends confirmation email, updates invoice "2 of 5 installments paid"

4. **Given** installment payment fails (insufficient funds)
   **When** Stripe webhook notifies payment failure
   **Then** system logs failure, schedules retry attempt #1 (in 24 hours), sends email to patient: "Payment failed. We'll retry in 24 hours. Please ensure sufficient funds."

5. **Given** all 3 retry attempts fail
   **When** final retry fails
   **Then** system flags booking as "Payment Failed", sends admin alert, sends email to patient: "Payment unsuccessful after 3 attempts. Please update payment method or contact support.", booking moves to "At Risk" status

---

### User Story 3 - Discount Usage & ROI Tracking (Priority: P2)

An admin reviews discount performance and financial impact inside Billing & Finance using discount data created and governed in FR-019 / A-06.

**Why this priority**: Finance and operations need reconciliation visibility into discount cost, fee split, and attributed revenue without duplicating discount management ownership from FR-019.

**Independent Test**: Seed active discounts in FR-019, apply them to bookings at checkout, then verify FR-017 Screen 5 displays usage counts, cost split, attributed revenue, and deep-link access to the canonical FR-019 management record.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** discount codes already exist in FR-019 / A-06 AND have been applied to bookings
   **When** admin opens "Billing & Finance" → "Discount Usage Overview"
   **Then** system displays each code with: code, name, type, times used, total discount amount, Hairline cost, provider cost (if applicable), revenue generated, ROI, and status

2. **Given** admin clicks a discount row in Screen 5
   **When** the row action executes
   **Then** system opens the canonical discount detail in FR-019 / A-06 using a deep link; FR-017 remains read-only

3. **Given** a discount affects "Both Fees"
   **When** admin reviews the code in Screen 5
   **Then** system displays separate Hairline Cost and Provider Cost values derived from the fee allocation defined in FR-019

4. **Given** finance wants to reconcile a campaign's impact
   **When** admin filters the discount usage list by status/date range and sorts by ROI
   **Then** system shows the highest and lowest performing campaigns based on booking revenue attributed versus discount cost

5. **Given** a discount is expired or disabled in FR-019
   **When** admin views Screen 5
   **Then** the same status appears in FR-017, but no creation, edit, activation, or approval actions are available from A-05

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Currency Booking with Locked Exchange Rates (Priority: P1)

A patient from the UK books a treatment in Turkey, pays in GBP, while the provider receives payout in EUR, with exchange rates locked at booking time to protect both parties from currency fluctuations.

**Why this priority**: Multi-currency support essential for international medical tourism platform; locked rates prevent disputes and financial losses from rate fluctuations.

**Independent Test**: Create booking with patient currency GBP and provider currency EUR, verify exchange rate locked at booking, advance time, verify payout uses locked rate regardless of current market rate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** patient (UK) accepts quote from provider (Turkey) with treatment price £2,000 GBP
   **When** patient confirms booking and completes payment
   **Then** system locks exchange rate at booking time (e.g., 1 GBP = 1.17 EUR), stores locked rate in booking record, displays on invoice: "Exchange rate locked: 1 GBP = 1.17 EUR"

2. **Given** booking completed and treatment marked "Aftercare" (ready for payout)
   **When** admin processes provider payout (2 weeks after booking)
   **Then** system uses LOCKED exchange rate (1 GBP = 1.17 EUR) for payout calculation, provider receives £2,000 × 1.17 = €2,340 (minus commission), NOT current market rate

3. **Given** current market exchange rate has changed (1 GBP = 1.22 EUR) after booking
   **When** admin views payout detail modal
   **Then** system displays: "Booking Amount: £2,000 GBP", "Exchange Rate (Locked): 1.17 EUR", "Provider Payout: €2,340 EUR", "Note: Exchange rate locked at booking time"

4. **Given** provider views payout history in Provider Platform
   **When** provider clicks on payout record
   **Then** provider sees itemized breakdown with locked exchange rate details, confirming payout amount matches booking expectations

---

### User Story 5 - Financial Dashboard for Executive Reporting (Priority: P2)

Hairline executives and finance team view real-time financial dashboard to monitor platform revenue, provider payouts, outstanding invoices, and key metrics for business decision-making.

**Why this priority**: Executive visibility into financial health critical for strategic planning; real-time data enables rapid response to revenue trends.

**Independent Test**: Generate test data (100 bookings, 20 providers, 5 affiliates) across 90 days, navigate to financial dashboard, verify all charts and metrics display correctly, test filtering by date range and currency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin navigates to "Financial Reporting" → "Revenue Dashboard"
   **When** dashboard loads with default date range (last 30 days) and default currency (USD)
   **Then** system displays: Total Revenue ($XXX,XXX), Platform Commission ($XX,XXX), Provider Payouts ($XX,XXX), Outstanding Patient Invoices ($X,XXX), Pending Provider Payouts ($XX,XXX)

2. **Given** admin changes date range to "Last 90 days" AND currency to "EUR"
   **When** system recalculates metrics
   **Then** all currency amounts converted to EUR, charts update to show 90-day data, dashboard loads within 3 seconds

3. **Given** admin views "Revenue by Country" pie chart
   **When** admin clicks on "Turkey" segment (40% of revenue)
   **Then** dashboard filters to show only Turkey bookings, all metrics recalculate for Turkey subset, breadcrumb displays "Filtered: Turkey"

4. **Given** admin views "Top Providers by Revenue" table
   **When** admin sorts by "Booking Count" (descending)
   **Then** table reorders to show providers with most bookings at top, displaying: provider name, booking count, total revenue, average booking value

5. **Given** admin clicks "Export Full Report" button
   **When** system generates PDF report
   **Then** PDF includes all dashboard data (charts as images, tables, metrics), downloads within 10 seconds, filename: "Hairline_Financial_Report_[date_range].pdf"

---

### User Story 6 - Refund Processing with Approval Workflow (Priority: P2)

A patient requests refund due to cancellation, admin reviews request against cancellation policy, processes partial or full refund, and system updates all financial records.

**Why this priority**: Refund handling impacts customer satisfaction and platform reputation; automated workflow ensures policy compliance and audit trail.

**Independent Test**: Create confirmed booking, simulate cancellation request at different timeframes (>30 days, 15-30 days, <15 days), process refund, verify correct amount calculated per policy, Stripe refund initiated, invoice updated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** patient cancels booking 45 days before treatment date
   **When** admin navigates to "Patient Billing" → searches for patient invoice → clicks "Process Refund"
   **Then** system calculates refund amount per cancellation policy (90% of total = £1,800 for £2,000 booking), displays: "Refund Amount: £1,800 (90% per policy)", "Platform Fee (non-refundable): £200"

2. **Given** admin reviews refund details AND clicks "Approve Refund"
   **When** system prompts admin to enter a mandatory reason (free text, max 500 characters) and confirm
   **Then** admin enters reason (e.g., "Patient cancelled >30 days before treatment — 90% refund per policy") and confirms

3. **Given** admin confirms refund
   **When** system initiates Stripe refund and logs the action
   **Then** Stripe refund API call succeeds, refund status "Processing", admin sees confirmation "Refund initiated. Funds will return to patient card within 5-7 business days", audit trail entry created with admin ID, timestamp, reason, before/after status

4. **Given** Stripe refund completes (webhook received)
   **When** system processes webhook event
   **Then** invoice updated: "Status: Refunded", "Refund Amount: £1,800", "Refund Date: [date]", patient receives email: "Your refund of £1,800 has been processed", provider payout adjusted (if not yet processed)

5. **Given** provider payout not yet processed (treatment was upcoming)
   **When** refund completes
   **Then** system removes booking from provider's upcoming payout calculation, provider does NOT receive payment for cancelled booking

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** patient's card expires before installment payment due?
  - System attempts charge, receives "expired card" error from Stripe
  - System sends email to patient: "Payment method expired. Please update card to continue installment plan."
  - Patient updates card via P-01: Auth & Profile Management → Payment Methods
  - System retries charge with updated card on next scheduled attempt

- **How does system handle** provider payout when provider's bank account is closed?
  - Stripe transfer fails with "invalid bank account" error
  - System flags payout as "Failed", sends admin alert
  - Admin contacts provider via support system to request updated bank account
  - Provider updates bank account in PR-06: Profile & Settings Management
  - Admin verifies new account and manually retries payout

- **What occurs if** discount code reaches maximum usage limit mid-checkout?
  - Patient enters discount code "SUMMER25" at checkout (usage: 499/500)
  - Another patient simultaneously applies same code (usage: 500/500)
  - First patient completes checkout: discount applied successfully
  - Second patient completes checkout: system displays "Discount code no longer available (maximum uses reached)"
  - System prevents race condition using database row locking on discount code record

- **How to manage** currency exchange rate API downtime during booking?
  - Patient initiates booking requiring EUR → GBP conversion
  - System attempts to fetch latest exchange rate from API, receives timeout error
  - System uses cached exchange rate (refreshed 1 hour ago) with warning notification to admin: "Using cached rate (1 hour old) due to API unavailability"
  - System flags booking for manual review if cached rate >24 hours old
  - Admin reviews and approves rate OR contacts patient to confirm acceptable rate

- **What happens when** affiliate discount code and provider discount code both applied?
  - Patient enters or arrives through "AFFILIATE10" (affiliate-bound code/link), and a provider-side promotion "PROVIDER15" is also eligible or applied during checkout
  - System applies the single-discount priority rule to the patient's final price: Patient code > Provider code > Affiliate code
  - If the provider promotion wins the price discount, the patient-facing price breakdown uses "PROVIDER15"; the affiliate discount line is not double-applied
  - System preserves the valid "AFFILIATE10" affiliate referral attribution separately because the provider-side promotion is outside the patient's knowledge
  - When the booking completes with payment confirmation, FR-017 processes affiliate payout execution using the FR-018 commission output for the preserved affiliate attribution

- **What happens when** a patient is refunded after the provider has already been paid out?
  - Patient cancels booking 10 days before treatment; provider was paid out 3 weeks ago (Stripe transfer complete)
  - Admin processes refund for patient per cancellation policy (e.g., 0% refund if <15 days, but admin may apply discretionary partial refund with mandatory justification)
  - Refund is returned to patient via Stripe; the provider payout is NOT clawed back immediately — the equivalent provider amount (commission-adjusted) is deducted from the provider's NEXT payout cycle
  - Screen 9 (Provider Earnings Tracker): the refunded treatment row is updated with Adjustment Marker "Refunded — Deducted from Next Payout" and Net Earning shows the negative adjustment amount clearly
  - The deduction is included as a separate line item in the provider's next payout statement (Screen 3 — Provider Payout Detail Modal), labelled "Adjustment: Refund deducted — [Booking Reference] — [Date]", reducing the net payout for that cycle
  - If the deduction exceeds the provider's next payout amount (e.g., provider has no other completed treatments that cycle), the deduction carries forward to the subsequent cycle — it is never silently absorbed by Hairline
  - The audit trail records: refund event, deduction amount, affected payout statement ID, and admin ID

- **How does system handle** partial refund (patient cancels add-on packages but keeps base treatment)?
  - Patient booked treatment (£2,000) + hotel package (£500) + PRP add-on (£200), total £2,700
  - Patient cancels hotel and PRP, keeps base treatment
  - Admin processes partial refund: £500 + £200 = £700
  - System initiates Stripe refund for £700, updates invoice: "Partial Refund: £700", "New Total: £2,000"
  - Provider payout adjusted: original commission calculated on £2,700, recalculated on £2,000

| 2026-04-02 | 2.0 | Constitution and ownership alignment: refund control now follows documented justification + audit trail (matching the amended constitution); commission ownership clarified as FR-015 provider-specific override plus payout frequency, with FR-029 supplying the global default/snapshot policy; provider bank-detail ownership normalized to FR-032 Billing Settings; stale patient-dashboard invoice wording removed from dependencies | Codex |
| 2026-04-02 | 2.1 | Reporting currency alignment: Screen 1 revenue dashboard now initializes from the FR-029 system default currency (seeded as USD for MVP), acceptance scenario examples updated to USD, and the FR-029 dependency note now documents this filter-source relationship | Codex |
| 2026-04-02 | 2.2 | Screen ownership grouping correction: clarified tenant scope so Admin Platform covers Screens 1–6 and 9–10, limited the Provider Platform section to Screens 7–8 only, and inserted a dedicated admin investigation/audit subsection before Screens 9–10 to match their actual access rules | Codex |
| 2026-04-02 | 2.3 | Screen renumbering alignment: moved the admin investigation/audit tools into contiguous admin numbering as Screens 7–8, shifted provider read-only payout screens to 9–10, updated cross-references and FR-032 shell dependency text, and normalized active-alert links to the new Currency Alert modal number. Historical changelog entries before v2.3 retain the pre-v2.3 labels used at that time | Codex |
| 2026-04-02 | 2.4 | Status updated from Draft to ✅ Verified & Approved and approval metadata aligned to the verified-template pattern used by other approved FRs | Codex |
| 2026-04-02 | 2.5 | Commission-source model realigned to implemented admin design: FR-029 again exposes provider-specific commission scope management alongside the global default, FR-015 remains the single-provider commission + payout-frequency surface, and all payout/reporting references now point to the shared effective commission configuration instead of the prior FR-015-only provider-specific split | Codex |
| 2026-06-23 | 2.6 | FR-018 attribution alignment: corrected the affiliate-vs-provider discount edge case so the single-discount priority controls only the patient's final price. A valid captured affiliate-bound code/link remains preserved as affiliate referral attribution and still feeds FR-018 commission output consumed by FR-017 for payout execution after payment-confirmed booking completion. | Codex |
