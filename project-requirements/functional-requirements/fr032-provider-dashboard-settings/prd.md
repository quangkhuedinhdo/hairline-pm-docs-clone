## Executive Summary

Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management enables clinic administrators and staff to configure their organization's profile, account settings, notification preferences, billing information, and team member permissions. This module provides providers with full control over their public-facing clinic information (logo, awards, languages), account security (password, phone, timezone), unified notification preferences (email, push), billing setup (bank accounts for payouts), and access to comprehensive help resources. The module serves as the centralized configuration hub for all provider-level settings, ensuring providers can efficiently manage their presence on the Hairline platform while maintaining security and compliance.

- **Hairline Admin**: Reduced support tickets through self-service settings and help center
- **Platform**: Consistent provider data quality and secure credential management

| New Password | password | Yes (for password change) | New password | Min 12 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 special char (!@#$%^&(),.?\":{}<>) per FR-026 | Editable by all roles |
| Confirm New Password | password | Yes (for password change) | Confirm new password | Must match New Password field | Editable by all roles |

**Business Rules**:

- **Account Name Unification (Owner Role)**:
  - For Owner accounts (main account holder/provider admin): Account Name is unified with the clinic name from Tab 1: Basic Information (clinic name field)
  - Account Name field is read-only for Owner role; it automatically syncs when clinic name is updated in Tab 1
  - If Owner updates clinic name in Tab 1, Account Name in Tab 2 updates automatically (within 1 minute)
  - Account Name displays clinic name with read-only indicator (e.g., "Istanbul Hair Clinic" with lock icon or "Synced with clinic name" helper text)
  - Rationale: Owner account represents the clinic organization, so account name should match clinic name for consistency across the platform
  
- **Account Name (Staff Roles)**:
  - For Staff roles (Manager, Clinical Staff, Billing Staff): Account Name is editable and independent from clinic name
  - Default Account Name for staff is "First Name + Last Name" (e.g., "John Smith")
  - Staff can customize Account Name to any display name (e.g., "Dr. John Smith", "John S.", "J. Smith")
  - Account Name for staff is used for display purposes in dashboard, notifications, activity logs, and team member listings
  - Staff Account Name changes do not affect clinic name or other staff members' account names
  - Rationale: Staff are individual team members, not the clinic itself, so they should have personalized display names
  
- Phone number country code and number stored together in international format (e.g., +44 7700 900123)
- Timezone preference applies to all date/time displays in provider dashboard
- Existing timestamps in database remain in UTC, converted to provider's timezone for display
- Password change requires correct current password (security measure)
- New password must meet password policy from FR-026 (FIXED in codebase, not admin-editable)
- Password change event logged in audit trail (timestamp, user ID, IP address)
- Email notification sent to provider email address after successful password change (security alert)
- All account-level fields (account name, first name, last name, account email, phone number, timezone, password) are provider-editable by the logged-in user, subject to role-based restrictions (Account Name read-only for Owner) and FR-026 security rules and FR-009 role permissions

**Notes**:

- **Account Name Field**:
  - For Owner: Display Account Name with read-only indicator (lock icon or "Synced with clinic name" helper text); clicking may show tooltip "Account name is unified with clinic name. Update clinic name in Profile tab to change this."
  - For Staff: Display Account Name as editable text field with placeholder "e.g., Dr. John Smith" and helper text "This is how your name appears in the dashboard and notifications"
  - Account Name field appears at the top of the Account Information tab for clarity
  
- Phone number field should auto-format based on selected country code (e.g., (555) 123-4567 for USA)
- Provide real-time password strength indicator for new password field
- Show password requirements checklist with visual checkmarks as user types
- Timezone dropdown should include offset and city examples (e.g., "(GMT+3) Istanbul")
- Provide "Show/Hide Password" toggle icon for password fields
- Display last password change date below password section
- Include a dedicated **Delete Account** warning card at the bottom of the Account Information tab with explanatory copy and a red `Delete account` button; clicking the button opens the Account Deletion dialog described in the "Request Account Deletion" flow, where the reason textarea remains provider-editable while approval status stays admin-controlled
- Account Settings shares the Settings page with Notification Preferences as a two-tab interface; the `Account Information` tab (this screen) is the default tab when landing on Settings
- Each tab can be saved independently; system displays unsaved changes indicator on tabs with edits
- When provider attempts to navigate away or quit, system displays reminder dialog for unsaved changes

- When provider attempts to navigate away or quit, system displays reminder dialog "You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?" with options to save, discard, or cancel
- Critical system alerts (e.g., payment failure, security breach) bypass preferences and always sent via all available channels
- Preference changes logged in audit trail
- Preference updates propagate to S-03 within 1 minute
- All notification type and channel toggles are provider-editable from the `Settings → Notification Preferences` tab in the provider dashboard

- Show real-time preview of notification channels (e.g., "You will receive Quote Notifications via Email and Push")
- Display last preference update timestamp
- Provide "Test Notification" button to send sample notification and verify settings work
- Notification Preferences appears as the second tab on the Settings page beside Account Information; toggling between tabs should maintain unsaved changes warning if applicable

- Reopening reason required (min 20 chars) to prevent accidental/spam reopening
- Provider can optionally adjust priority when reopening (e.g., escalate if issue was marked resolved incorrectly)
- When submitted:
  - Case status changes from "Closed" to "Open"
  - System logs reopening in case timeline with timestamp, reopening reason, and provider who requested
  - FR-034 triggers support.case_reopened notification event to S-03
  - S-03 sends email notification to assigned admin (or all support staff if unassigned)
  - Admin receives notification with reopening reason and previous resolution for context
- System displays confirmation: "Reopen request submitted. We'll review your case shortly."
- After submission, modal closes and provider returns to Screen 5.8 with updated case status "Open"
- Reply Message Box becomes enabled again for reopened cases

**Notes**:

- Display warning if case was recently closed (e.g., within 24 hours): "This case was recently closed. Are you sure the issue persists?"
- Show estimated response time: "Our team typically responds to reopen requests within 4 hours."
- Consider adding "Reopen Reason Templates" dropdown for quick selection (e.g., "Issue persists", "New information available") (future enhancement)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies (Other FRs/Modules)

- **FR-020 / S-03: Notification Service**: Notification preferences integration
  - **Why needed**: Provider notification preferences must be enforced when S-03 sends notifications (quote alerts, schedule reminders, review notifications)
  - **Integration point**: When provider saves notification preferences, system updates S-03 preference rules; S-03 checks preferences before sending each notification

- **FR-026 / A-09: App Settings & Security Policies**: Language options for profile (centrally managed with country list)
  - **Why needed**: Profile language selection must display available system languages
  - **Integration point**: Profile language dropdown consumes centrally managed language list from FR-026 system configuration (same as country list management)

- **FR-026 / A-09: App Settings & Security Policies**: Country codes, timezone options, password policy
  - **Why needed**: Account settings require worldwide country calling codes, timezone list, and password validation rules
  - **Integration point**: Phone number country code dropdown consumes FR-026 country list; timezone dropdown consumes FR-026 timezone list; password change validates against FR-026 password policy

- **FR-009 / PR-01: Provider Team & Role Management**: Role-based access control for billing settings
  - **Why needed**: Billing settings must be accessible ONLY to Owner role per FR-009 role permissions
  - **Integration point**: System validates user role before allowing access to billing settings; non-owner roles denied access

- **FR-017 / A-05: Admin Billing & Financial Management**: Bank account details for payouts
  - **Why needed**: Bank account details saved in billing settings used by FR-017 for provider payouts
  - **Integration point**: When admin triggers provider payout (FR-017), system retrieves bank account details from billing settings

- **FR-033 / A-09: Help Centre Content Management**: Help Centre content
  - **Why needed**: Help Centre displays admin-managed content (FAQs, guides, videos, resources)
  - **Integration point**: Help Centre reads content from admin-managed content database; content updates from admin propagate to provider Help Centre view

- **FR-034 / A-10: Support Center & Ticketing**: Provider support request and feedback submission management with two-way communication
  - **Why needed**: Provider submissions via Screen 5.5 (Contact Support) and Screen 5.6 (Feedback & Suggestions) automatically create support cases in FR-034 ticketing system; providers need to view case status, read admin responses, and reply within communication thread
  - **Integration point**: Form submissions create support cases with provider ID linked and Ticket Source = "Provider Portal", Submitter Type = "Provider"; providers view and interact with their cases through Screen 5.7 (My Support Cases) which queries FR-034 case data including full communication thread; provider replies sent to FR-034 Communication Thread appear in admin's case detail view (FR-034 Screen 3); notification events (support.case_admin_reply, support.case_user_reply) trigger via S-03

### External Dependencies (APIs, Services)

- **S-02 Payment Processing Service**: Bank account validation
  - **Purpose**: Validates bank account details format before saving in billing settings
  - **Integration**: RESTful API call to S-02 with bank account details (account number, SWIFT/routing code, IBAN)
  - **Failure handling**: If S-02 validation fails, display error message to provider and prevent saving; provider must correct bank details and retry

- **S-03 Notification Service**: Notification preference enforcement
  - **Purpose**: Enforces provider notification preferences when sending notifications
  - **Integration**: System updates S-03 preference database when provider saves notification preferences; S-03 queries preferences before sending each notification
  - **Failure handling**: If S-03 unavailable during preference save, queue preference update for retry; provider sees success message but preferences may take up to 5 minutes to propagate

### Data Dependencies

- **Entity 1: Provider Profile Data (from PR-01: Auth & Team Management)**: Provider account information
  - **Why needed**: Settings module requires existing provider account with clinic name, email, and role information
  - **Source**: Provider onboarding module (A-02: Provider Management & Onboarding creates provider account; PR-01 manages team members)

- **Entity 2: System Configuration Data (from A-09: System Settings & Configuration / FR-026)**: Language list (centrally managed with country list), country codes, timezone list, password policy
  - **Why needed**: Account settings and profile require system-wide configuration data
  - **Source**: FR-026 provides centrally managed language and country lists consumed by settings module

- **Entity 3: Help Centre Content (from FR-033: Help Centre Content Management)**: FAQs, guides, videos, resources
  - **Why needed**: Help Centre displays admin-managed content
  - **Source**: A-09 (admins create and manage Help Centre content via FR-033)

---

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Providers will complete profile setup (logo, description, awards) within first 7 days of account activation to maximize patient quote requests
- **Assumption 2**: Providers will enable at least email notifications (most providers prefer email over push)
- **Assumption 3**: Provider Owners will add bank account details before completing first treatment (required for receiving payouts)
- **Assumption 4**: Providers will use Help Centre for common questions before contacting support (self-service first)

### Technology Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Providers access web platform via modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge - last 2 versions) per NFR-006
- **Assumption 2**: Providers have stable internet connection for image uploads (logo, awards)
- **Assumption 3**: Providers have access to bank account information (account number, SWIFT/routing code) when setting up billing
- **Assumption 4**: Help Centre content (videos, documents) delivered via CDN for fast loading

### Business Process Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Admins update Help Centre content at least monthly to keep resources current and relevant
- **Assumption 2**: Admins review and approve provider account deletion requests within 5 business days
- **Assumption 3**: Provider profile updates (logo, awards) reviewed by admin for quality assurance (future enhancement, not MVP)
- **Assumption 4**: Bank account details remain valid for at least 12 months; providers responsible for updating if bank account changes

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Settings module requires real-time synchronization with S-03 Notification Service for preference enforcement; use message queue for asynchronous preference updates to prevent blocking
- **Technology**: Image uploads (logo, awards) should use resumable upload protocol to handle network interruptions during large file uploads
- **Performance**: Profile updates should use optimistic UI updates (display success immediately, synchronize with backend asynchronously) to improve perceived performance
- **Storage**: Bank account details encrypted at rest using AES-256; encryption keys managed via secure key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS)

### Integration Points

- **Integration 1**: Provider Settings → S-03 Notification Service (notification preference enforcement)
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with provider ID, notification type toggles (quote, schedule, treatment, aftercare, review), channel preferences (email, push)
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 bearer token (service-to-service)
  - **Error handling**: Retry with exponential backoff on 5xx errors; if S-03 unavailable for >5 minutes, log error and notify admin

- **Integration 2**: Billing Settings → S-02 Payment Service (bank account validation)
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with account holder name, bank name, account number, SWIFT/routing code, IBAN, country code
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 bearer token (service-to-service)
  - **Error handling**: Display S-02 validation error message to provider; prevent saving until validation succeeds

- **Integration 3**: Help Centre → Admin Content Database (read-only content display)
  - **Data format**: JSON API response with Help Centre content (categories, articles, FAQs, videos, resources)
  - **Authentication**: Internal API (user authentication required, RBAC enforced per FR-009 as this is an authenticated provider area)
  - **Error handling**: If content unavailable, display cached version with "Content may be outdated" warning; retry after 1 minute

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current scale**: Expected 100-200 providers updating settings daily at launch
- **Growth projection**: Plan for 1,000 providers updating settings daily within 12 months
- **Peak load**: Handle 10x normal load during onboarding campaigns (1,000 concurrent profile updates)
- **Data volume**: Expect 500KB average per provider profile (logo, awards, settings); total ~50MB for 100 providers, ~500MB for 1,000 providers
- **Scaling strategy**: Horizontal scaling of API servers; CDN for image delivery (logos, awards); database read replicas for Help Centre content

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for Owner role when accessing billing settings (future enhancement)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced for billing settings (Owner role only); API endpoints validate user role before allowing access
- **Encryption**: All provider data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256); bank account details use field-level encryption with separate encryption keys
- **Audit trail**: Log all settings changes (profile, account, notifications, billing) with timestamp, user ID, IP address, action, old value, new value
- **Threat mitigation**: Rate limiting on password change endpoint (max 5 attempts/hour/user) to prevent brute force attacks; rate limiting on image upload endpoint (max 10 uploads/hour/user) to prevent abuse
- **Compliance**: GDPR-compliant account deletion (soft-delete with data archival); PCI-DSS compliance for bank account data handling (no card data stored, only bank account details for payouts)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Complete Provider Profile Setup (Priority: P1)

A newly onboarded provider (Owner role) completes their clinic profile by uploading logo, entering description, selecting languages, and adding awards to maximize visibility to patients during quote comparison.

**Why this priority**: Profile completeness directly impacts patient trust and quote request conversion rate. Providers with complete profiles (logo, awards, description) receive 40% more quote requests than providers with incomplete profiles.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating new provider account, uploading logo and awards, saving profile, and verifying profile appears correctly in patient quote comparison view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider has newly created account with incomplete profile, **When** provider navigates to Profile section and uploads clinic logo (2MB PNG), enters description (200 chars), selects 3 languages (English, Turkish, Spanish), and saves profile, **Then** system saves profile successfully, displays "Profile updated successfully" message, and profile appears in patient app within 1 minute with logo, description, and language tags
2. **Given** provider has completed basic profile, **When** provider adds award entry (name: "Best Hair Transplant Clinic 2023", description: "Awarded by Medical Tourism Association", year: 2023, uploads award image 1.5MB JPEG), **Then** system validates award image size and format, saves award entry, displays award in "Awards & Certifications" section in provider profile
3. **Given** provider attempts to save profile with missing required field (description empty), **When** provider clicks "Save Changes", **Then** system validates form, highlights description field in red, displays error "Clinic description is required (min 50 chars)", and prevents saving until description completed

---

### User Story 2 - Configure Notification Preferences (Priority: P1)

A provider clinic coordinator configures notification preferences to receive email and push notifications for quote and schedule alerts, but disables aftercare notifications (handled by different team).

**Why this priority**: Notification preferences directly impact provider response time to patient inquiries. Providers who configure preferences to match their workflow respond to quotes 30% faster than providers using default settings.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring notification preferences, triggering test notifications (quote alert, schedule reminder), and verifying notifications sent only via enabled channels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider has default notification preferences (all types enabled, email and push enabled), **When** provider navigates to Settings → Notifications, disables "Aftercare Notifications" toggle, saves preferences, **Then** system saves preferences, displays "Notification preferences updated" message, updates S-03 Notification Service, and provider receives no aftercare notifications but receives quote/schedule notifications via email and push
2. **Given** provider disables all notification types, **When** provider clicks "Save Preferences", **Then** system displays confirmation dialog "Warning: You have disabled all notifications. You may miss important updates about inquiries, appointments, and reviews. Are you sure?", requires provider confirmation, and if confirmed, saves "all disabled" preference and S-03 stops sending notifications (except critical system alerts)

---

### User Story 3 - Update Account Settings (Phone, Timezone, Password) (Priority: P1)

A provider updates their phone number, changes timezone to match clinic location after relocation, and changes password for security.

**Why this priority**: Account settings ensure provider security and localization. Timezone accuracy ensures providers don't miss appointment times due to timezone confusion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating phone number, timezone, and password in account settings, verifying changes saved correctly, and confirming password change email sent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider has phone number +90 555 123 4567 (Turkey) and timezone (GMT+3) Istanbul, **When** provider navigates to Account Settings, changes country code to +44 (UK), enters phone number 7700 900123, changes timezone to (GMT+0) London, saves settings, **Then** system validates phone number format for UK, saves phone number in international format (+44 7700 900123), saves timezone preference, displays success message, and all future dashboard timestamps display in London timezone
2. **Given** provider wants to change password, **When** provider enters current password "OldP@ssw0rd2023!", enters new password "NewP@ssw0rd2024!", enters confirmation "NewP@ssw0rd2024!", clicks "Change Password", **Then** system validates current password matches database, validates new password meets security policy (≥12 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 special char), hashes new password using bcrypt, saves password hash, logs password change in audit trail, displays "Password changed successfully" message, and sends email notification to provider email address
3. **Given** provider enters incorrect current password when changing password, **When** provider submits password change form, **Then** system validates current password, detects mismatch, displays error "Current password is incorrect", and prevents password change until correct current password entered

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Billing Settings (Owner Role Only) (Priority: P1)

A provider Owner adds bank account details for receiving payouts from Hairline platform after completing first treatment.

**Why this priority**: Billing settings required for provider payouts per FR-017. Without bank account details, provider cannot receive payout for completed treatments. 95% of providers add billing settings within 7 days of completing first treatment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding bank account details as Owner role, verifying S-02 validation succeeds, confirming bank account saved encrypted, and testing non-owner role denied access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider Owner has completed first treatment and needs to receive payout, **When** provider Owner navigates to Settings → Billing, enters bank account details (Account Holder: "Istanbul Hair Clinic Ltd", Bank: "Garanti BBVA", Account Number: "TR123456789012345678901234", SWIFT: "TGBATRISXXX", IBAN: "TR12 0001 0012 3456 7890 1234 56"), clicks "Save Bank Account", **Then** system sends validation request to S-02 Payment Service, S-02 validates bank account format, system saves bank account details encrypted with AES-256, logs billing settings change in audit trail, displays "Bank account details saved successfully" message, sends confirmation email to Owner, and bank account used for next provider payout
2. **Given** provider Owner enters invalid IBAN format (too short), **When** provider Owner submits bank account form with IBAN "TR1234", **Then** system validates IBAN format, detects invalid format (Turkey IBAN requires 26 chars), displays error "Invalid IBAN format. Turkey IBAN must be 26 characters (e.g., TR12 0001 0012 3456 7890 1234 56)", and prevents saving until valid IBAN entered
3. **Given** provider has Admin role (not Owner), **When** provider Admin navigates to Settings & Support > Settings, **Then** system validates user role, detects role ≠ Owner, and hides the Billing tab from navigation (non-owner cannot see or access billing settings)

---

### User Story 5 - Access Help Centre Resources (Priority: P2)

A provider searches Help Centre for answer to question "How do I edit a quote after submission?" and finds answer in FAQ without contacting support.

**Why this priority**: Help Centre self-service reduces support ticket volume by 40% and improves provider satisfaction. 70% of provider questions resolved via Help Centre without support contact.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing Help Centre, searching for FAQ, reading answer, submitting feedback, and verifying support request form works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider has question about editing quotes, **When** provider navigates to Help Centre, clicks "FAQs" category, selects topic "Quote Management", clicks question "How do I edit a quote after submission?", **Then** system expands answer with detailed instructions, provider reads answer, clicks "Was this helpful? Yes", system records feedback for admin analytics
2. **Given** provider needs to contact support, **When** provider navigates to Help Centre, clicks "Contact Support", fills support form (Subject: "Payment issue", Message: "I haven't received my payout for last week", uploads screenshot 2MB PNG), submits request, **Then** system validates form, sends support request to admin team, displays confirmation "Support request submitted. Our team will respond within 24 hours.", and admin receives support request in admin dashboard
3. **Given** provider wants to download quote template, **When** provider navigates to Help Centre, clicks "Resource Library", clicks "Download Quote Template" (PDF file), **Then** system initiates file download, provider saves file to local device

---

### User Story 6 - View and Reply to Support Cases (Two-Way Communication) (Priority: P2)

A provider submits a support request about a technical issue, receives admin response, replies with additional information, and tracks the case resolution through two-way conversation.

**Why this priority**: Two-way communication with admin support improves provider satisfaction and reduces resolution time by 40% compared to email-only support. Providers need visibility into case status and ability to provide follow-up information without creating duplicate tickets.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting support request via Screen 5.5, viewing case in My Support Cases screen (Screen 5.7), reading admin reply, sending reply message with attachment, verifying message appears in admin's case view (FR-034 Screen 3), and confirming notifications sent via S-03.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider submitted support request yesterday about payment issue, **When** admin replies to case with troubleshooting steps, **Then** provider receives email notification "Your support case CASE-2025-12345 has a new reply", provider clicks link in email, system opens My Support Cases screen with case auto-expanded, provider reads admin's reply in Communication Thread, provider clicks Reply Message Box, types "Thank you, I tried those steps but still having the issue", attaches error screenshot, clicks Send Reply, system sends reply to FR-034, displays confirmation "Reply sent", and admin receives notification via S-03
2. **Given** provider has 3 open support cases and 2 closed cases, **When** provider navigates to Help Centre → My Support Cases, **Then** system displays case list with 5 cases total, default filter shows 3 open cases (Open + In Progress statuses), each case row shows Case ID, Title, Type, Status badge, Submitted Date, Last Updated, and Unread indicator showing "2" for cases with new admin replies, provider clicks filter to include Closed status, system displays all 5 cases
3. **Given** provider's issue was resolved and case is marked Closed, **When** provider discovers issue persists 2 days later, navigates to My Support Cases, opens closed case, **Then** system displays case with Status "Closed" and resolution summary, Reply Message Box is disabled with message "This case is closed. Click 'Request Reopen' if issue persists.", provider clicks Request Reopen button, system opens modal, provider enters reopening reason "Issue is still occurring after following all troubleshooting steps", selects priority "High", clicks Submit, system changes case status to Open, sends notification to admin via S-03, displays confirmation "Reopen request submitted"
4. **Given** provider wants to find past case about billing, **When** provider opens My Support Cases, enters "payout" in search bar, selects Resolved status filter, **Then** system displays all resolved cases containing keyword "payout" in Case ID, Title, Description, or Messages, provider clicks case to view details and reviews the case history for reference

---

### User Story 7 - Request Account Deletion (Priority: P2)

A provider closing their clinic permanently requests account deletion, and admin reviews and approves deletion request.

**Why this priority**: Account deletion allows provider to exercise GDPR "right to erasure" and ensures platform doesn't retain inactive accounts. Account deletion implemented as soft-delete with data archival per FR-023 compliance requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting account deletion request as provider, verifying admin receives request, admin approves deletion, provider account soft-deleted, and provider data archived.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** provider is closing clinic permanently, **When** provider navigates to Settings → Account Settings, clicks "Delete Account", checks "I understand" checkbox, enters reason "Closing clinic permanently", clicks "Submit Deletion Request", **Then** system validates provider has no active bookings or pending payouts, creates account deletion request with status "Pending Admin Approval", logs deletion request in audit trail, sends notification to admin team, displays confirmation "Account deletion request submitted. Our team will review and process your request within 5 business days.", and provider account remains active until admin approves
2. **Given** admin receives account deletion request, **When** admin reviews deletion request in admin dashboard, verifies provider has no active obligations, approves deletion request, **Then** system performs soft-delete (account status changed to "Deleted", provider login disabled, provider profile hidden from patient quote requests, all data retained in archive per FR-023), sends email confirmation to provider "Your account has been deleted. Your data has been archived per our data retention policy."
3. **Given** provider has 3 active bookings, **When** provider attempts to submit account deletion request, **Then** system validates provider obligations, detects active bookings, displays error "Cannot delete account. You have 3 active bookings. Please complete or cancel all bookings before deleting your account. For assistance, contact support at <support@hairlineapp.com>.", and blocks deletion request until bookings completed

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **provider uploads 10MB logo image exceeding 5MB limit**?
  - System validates image size during upload, detects size exceeds limit, displays error "Image too large. Maximum size is 5MB. Please compress or choose a smaller image.", and prevents upload until valid image selected

- How does system handle **provider changes password to same as current password**?
  - System validates new password ≠ current password, detects match, displays error "New password must be different from current password", and prevents password change until different password entered

- What occurs if **S-03 Notification Service unavailable when provider saves notification preferences**?
  - System attempts to update S-03 with new preferences, detects S-03 unavailable (timeout or 5xx error), queues preference update for retry (exponential backoff), displays success message to provider "Notification preferences updated" (optimistic UI), logs error for admin monitoring, and retries preference update every 1 minute for up to 5 minutes; if S-03 still unavailable after 5 minutes, admin receives alert

- What happens when **S-02 Payment Service returns validation error for bank account details**?
  - System receives validation error from S-02 (e.g., "Bank not found" or "SWIFT code mismatch"), displays error message to provider "Bank account validation failed: [error detail from S-02]. Please verify your bank details and try again.", prevents saving bank account details, and provider must correct details and retry

- How does system handle **provider Owner changes role to Admin (no longer Owner)**?
  - When admin changes provider's role from Owner to Admin (via FR-009), system detects role change, and next time user navigates to Settings & Support > Settings, the Billing tab is hidden from navigation (non-owner cannot see or access billing settings); existing bank account details remain saved and accessible to new Owner role user

- What occurs if **Help Centre content fails to load due to network issue**?
  - System attempts to fetch Help Centre content from admin content database, detects network timeout or error, displays cached version of Help Centre content (if available) with warning banner "Content may be outdated. Please refresh to load latest updates.", and provides "Retry" button for manual refresh

- How to manage **provider uploads award image with virus or malicious content**?
  - System scans uploaded image using anti-virus/malware scanning service (e.g., ClamAV), detects malicious content, deletes uploaded file, displays error "Image upload blocked due to security concerns. Please try a different image or contact support if this was a mistake.", logs security event for admin review, and prevents award image from being saved
