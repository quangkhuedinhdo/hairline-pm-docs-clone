# FR-035 - Patient Help Center & Support Submission

**Module**: P-08: Help Center & Support Access | Integrates with FR-033 (Help Centre Content Management) and FR-034 (Support Center & Ticketing System)

**Created**: 2026-03-06
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: FR-035 from system-prd.md, Client transcriptions (HairlineApp-Part2.txt, Hairline-AdminPlatform-Part1.txt, Hairline-ProviderPlatformPart2.txt), missing-mobile-flows-design-complement.md (Flow P08.1)

## Executive Summary

The Patient Help Center & Support Submission module provides the patient-facing interface for accessing self-service help content and submitting support requests directly from the patient mobile app. This feature acts as the patient-side reading layer for Help Centre content managed by admins via FR-033, and as the patient-side submission interface for support cases managed via FR-034.

**Key Objectives**:

- Provide patients with 24/7 access to self-service help resources (FAQs, articles, resources, videos) tailored to the patient audience
- Enable patients to submit support requests, feedback, and feature requests directly from the mobile app, creating tracked cases in FR-034
- Enable two-way threaded communication between patients and admin support staff within support cases
- Reduce support ticket volume by enabling patients to find answers independently before contacting support
- Maintain complete content isolation: patients see only patient-audience content, never provider content

**Problem Solved**: Without a dedicated patient-facing help center, patients must rely on external channels (email, phone) for support — leading to slower response times, lost inquiries, and no self-service path. This module ensures patients can find answers independently and, when needed, submit tracked support requests with full two-way communication and status visibility.

**Business Value**:

- **Improved Patient Satisfaction**: Immediate access to self-service answers and transparent ticket tracking with two-way communication
- **Reduced Support Load**: Self-service content deflects common questions, allowing admin staff to focus on complex issues
- **Complete Multi-Tenant Support**: Completes the support architecture across all three platforms (Patient via FR-035, Provider via FR-032, Admin via FR-034)
- **Compliance & Audit Trail**: All support interactions tracked with case IDs, timestamps, and communication history via FR-034
- **Healthcare Safety**: Emergency contact information always accessible for post-procedure patient safety

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-08)**: Full patient-facing Help Center experience — browse help content, search, submit support requests and feedback, view and manage support tickets with two-way communication
- **Provider Platform (PR-XX)**: Not applicable (providers access help via FR-032)
- **Admin Platform (A-XX)**: Not applicable (admins manage content via FR-033, manage tickets via FR-034)
- **Shared Services (S-03)**: Notification Service for support case email notifications (status changes, admin replies, case closure)

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

**Patient Platform (P-08)**:

- Patients access Help Center from patient mobile app navigation (Settings screen or in-app deep links)
- Patients browse help content organized by 4 content types: FAQs, Articles (Tutorial Guides + Troubleshooting Tips), Resources, Videos
- Patients search across all published patient-audience help content
- Patients view content detail with "Was this helpful?" feedback
- Patients submit support requests via Contact Support form, creating tracked cases in FR-034
- Patients view their submitted support tickets with status, priority, and communication thread
- Patients reply to admin messages within support cases (two-way threaded communication)
- Patients receive email and push notifications on case status changes and admin replies (via FR-020, S-03)

**Provider Platform (PR-XX)**:

- Not applicable — provider help center is handled by FR-032

**Admin Platform (A-XX)**:

- Not applicable — content management is handled by FR-033, ticket management by FR-034
- Admin actions that affect patient experience: publishing/unpublishing content (FR-033), responding to patient cases (FR-034), updating case status (FR-034)

**Shared Services (S-03)**:

- Sends email notifications to patients when support case status changes (Open -> In Progress, In Progress -> Resolved, Resolved -> Closed)
- Sends email notifications to patients when admin replies to their case
- Sends case closure notification when auto-closure period expires

### Communication Structure

**In Scope**:

- Patient browsing and reading admin-published Help Center content (read-only consumption of FR-033 content)
- Patient submitting support requests and feedback via Contact Support form (creates cases in FR-034)
- Patient viewing support ticket status, communication thread, and case details
- Patient replying to admin messages within support cases (two-way threaded communication via FR-034)
- Patient receiving notifications on case updates (via FR-020, S-03)
- Patient providing "Was this helpful?" feedback on help content (aggregated, anonymous)

**Out of Scope**:

- Help Center content creation, editing, publishing (handled by FR-033: Help Centre Content Management)
- Support case management, assignment, escalation, resolution (handled by FR-034: Support Center & Ticketing)
- Real-time in-app chat between patient and admin (future enhancement)
- Service Status page (provider-only feature per FR-033)
- Aftercare-specific communications (handled by FR-011: Aftercare & Recovery Management)
- Provider-to-patient secure messaging (handled by FR-012: Secure Messaging)
- Automated chatbot responses (future enhancement)
- Community forum (future enhancement)

### Entry Points

- Patient navigates to "Help & Support" from Settings screen (FR-026 / P01.2-S1)
- In-app deep link from other screens (e.g., contextual help links from booking, payment, or aftercare screens)
- Push notification tap (e.g., tapping a case status change notification navigates to Ticket Detail)

**Business Rules**:

- Tickets are ordered by most recently updated (newest activity at top) within each filter tab
- All statuses (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed) are visible in "All"; filter chips narrow the view per status group
- Creating a new ticket follows FR-034 Workflow A5: patient enters title (10-200 chars, mandatory), selects category (Technical Issue, Account Access, Payment Question, Booking Issue, General Inquiry, Feature Request, Bug Report, Feedback — "Provider Support" and "Patient Support" are admin-internal categories not shown to patients), enters description (20-5000 chars), selects priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent), and optionally attaches files (max 5 files, 10 MB each, JPG/PNG/PDF/DOC/DOCX); system creates case with Ticket Source = "Patient App", Submitter Type = "Patient" (FR-034 REQ-034-021, REQ-034-024)
- Patient receives a confirmation email with the case reference number upon submission (FR-020, FR-034 A5 step 11)
- Ticket cards are always tappable regardless of status — patients can view the full thread even for Closed cases
- Resolved cases display a subtle "Auto-closes in X days" indicator to set expectations about the closure window (FR-034 REQ-034-061)

If you still need help, you can create a new ticket or contact support to request this case be reopened." with "Create New Ticket" link to Screen 5 and "Contact Support" link (email/phone from Emergency Contact Section in Screen 1). Provides both paths: new ticket creation (in-app) and case reopening via admin (FR-034 Workflow B3, REQ-034-063, REQ-034-017). |
| Empty Thread State | text | Conditional | Shown when no messages exist yet (case just created) | "Your case has been submitted. Our team will respond within 24 hours." (aligns with FR-034 SC-003) |

**Business Rules**:

- Patients can reply to admin messages when the case is Open, In Progress, or **Resolved** (FR-034 REQ-034-026); **only Closed** cases are fully read-only. This is critical for healthcare — patients must be able to report that a resolved issue has recurred (e.g., post-treatment complications) during the auto-closure window.
- Replying to a Resolved case automatically reopens it to Open status; the patient sees the status badge update immediately and the admin receives a support.case_user_reply notification via FR-020
- Cases auto-close after 7 days in Resolved status if no patient reply (configurable: 3/7/14 days per FR-034 REQ-034-061/062); the patient receives a support.case_closed notification. The auto-closure countdown is visible in the Ticket Detail to set clear expectations.
- Patient replies are added to the shared communication thread and the assigned admin receives a notification via FR-020 (support.case_user_reply event)
- Internal admin notes are never shown to the patient — only messages explicitly sent to the patient are visible in the thread (FR-034 REQ-034-013, REQ-034-046)
- Feedback resolution field is only shown for feedback, feature request, or bug report case categories (FR-034 REQ-034-006); values: Implemented, Planned, Declined, Under Review
- Status changes (Open -> In Progress, In Progress -> Resolved, Resolved -> Closed) trigger push/email notifications to the patient per FR-020 (support.case_status_changed, support.case_resolved, support.case_closed)

### Screen 5: Contact Support Form

**Purpose**: Structured form for patients to submit new support requests or feedback, creating a tracked case in FR-034

**Data Fields**:

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description | Validation Rules |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Screen Title | text | Yes | "Contact Support" | Displayed at top of screen |
| Back Navigation | action | Yes | Back arrow to return to previous screen (Hub or Ticket List) | Top-left corner; prompts "Discard draft?" confirmation if form has unsaved input |
| Case Title | text | Yes | Patient-entered title describing their issue (FR-034 REQ-034-020) | Min 10 characters, max 200 characters; no auto-generation; placeholder: "Briefly describe your issue" |
| Category Picker | dropdown | Yes | Support case category selection | Options: Technical Issue, Account Access, Payment Question, Booking Issue, General Inquiry, Feature Request, Bug Report, Feedback (FR-034 REQ-034-030). "Provider Support" and "Patient Support" are admin-internal categories and are not shown to patients. Brief inline description per category to help patients select correctly: Feature Request = "Suggest a new feature or improvement", Bug Report = "Report something that is broken or not working as expected", Feedback = "Share general feedback about your experience". |
| Description | text | Yes | Detailed description of the issue or feedback | Multi-line input; min 20 characters, max 5000 characters (FR-034 REQ-034-035); placeholder: "Describe your issue in detail so we can help you faster" |
| Priority Picker | dropdown | Yes | Patient-selected priority level | Options: Low, Medium, High, Urgent (FR-034 REQ-034-031); default: Medium. Brief inline descriptions help patients self-triage: Low = "General question", Medium = "Something isn't working right", High = "Blocking my care or booking", Urgent = "Critical issue needing immediate attention" |
| Attachments | file | No | Optional file attachments (screenshots, documents) | Max 5 files per submission, max 10 MB per file; accepted formats: JPG, PNG, PDF, DOC, DOCX (FR-034 REQ-034-036/037); tap to add; shows thumbnail preview with remove option; virus-scanned before acceptance. **[Clarification Needed]** FR-034 REQ-034-036 says "maximum 5 files per case" — confirm whether this is per-submission or cumulative across the case lifecycle. |
| Submit Button | action | Yes | Submits the support request | Disabled until all required fields pass validation; on tap: creates case (CASE-YYYY-#####), links to patient record via session (FR-034 REQ-034-024), sets Ticket Source = "Patient App" and Submitter Type = "Patient", sends confirmation email (FR-034 A5 step 11) |
| Cancel / Discard | action | Yes | Cancels form and returns to previous screen | Prompts "Discard this request?" if any field has input; no data saved on cancel |

**Business Rules**:

- All fields except Attachments are mandatory; the Submit button remains disabled until Title (>= 10 chars), Category, Description (>= 20 chars), and Priority are all valid
- Upon successful submission, the system displays a confirmation screen showing the assigned Case ID (CASE-YYYY-#####) and the message "We will respond within 24 hours" (FR-034 SC-003), then navigates to My Support Tickets (Screen 3)
- File uploads are validated client-side (format + size) before upload and server-side (virus scan + format whitelist) before acceptance (FR-034 REQ-034-036/037)
- Category selection drives downstream admin routing — this is transparent to the patient but important for response time
- Priority inline descriptions are a healthcare UX pattern to reduce mis-triage; patients in distress tend to over-select "Urgent" without guidance, which degrades response quality for truly urgent cases
- **[Design Addition]** Category inline descriptions (Feature Request, Bug Report, Feedback) help patients distinguish between overlapping categories — all three appear in FR-034 REQ-034-030 but without patient-facing guidance on when to use each

## Business Rules

### General Module Rules

- **Rule 1**: All Help Center content is read-only for patients; content is managed exclusively by admins via FR-033 (REQ-033-008)
- **Rule 2**: Patient content is completely isolated from provider content — patients only see patient-audience content (FR-033 Rule 1, Rule 3, REQ-033-021)
- **Rule 3**: Support ticket submissions automatically create cases in FR-034 with Ticket Source = "Patient App" and Submitter Type = "Patient" (FR-034 REQ-034-024)
- **Rule 4**: Content updates published by admin propagate to patient view within 1 minute (FR-033)
- **Rule 5**: All timestamps displayed in user's local timezone

### Data & Privacy Rules

- **Privacy Rule 1**: "Was this helpful?" feedback is aggregated at the content level — admin dashboards show total Yes/No counts per content item. Individual patient identity is not stored with feedback responses (FR-033 Privacy Rule 2)
- **Privacy Rule 2**: Internal admin notes within support cases are never shown to patients — only messages explicitly sent to the patient are visible (FR-034 REQ-034-013, REQ-034-046)
- **Privacy Rule 3**: Patient support case data is accessible only to the submitting patient and authorized admin staff
- **Privacy Rule 4**: File attachments in support cases are virus-scanned before acceptance and encrypted at rest
- **Audit Rule**: All support case lifecycle events (creation, status changes, messages, attachments) are logged with timestamp and user ID in FR-034 case timeline

### Admin Editability Rules

**Editable by Admin**:

- Help Center content (FAQs, articles, resources, videos) — managed via FR-033
- Support case status, assignment, resolution — managed via FR-034
- Auto-closure period for resolved cases (3/7/14 days, default 7 days) — configured via FR-034
- Emergency contact phone number and email — configurable via FR-026 (App Settings)
- Patient-facing category descriptions and category visibility — managed via FR-033

**Fixed in Codebase (Not Editable)**:

- 4 content types for patient platform: FAQs, Articles, Resources, Videos (FR-033 REQ-033-003)
- Support case lifecycle workflow: Open -> In Progress -> Resolved -> Closed
- Case ID format: CASE-YYYY-#####
- File attachment limits: max 10 MB per file, max 5 files per case, formats: JPG/PNG/PDF/DOC/DOCX
- Contact Support form validation: title min 10 chars, description min 20 chars

**Configurable with Restrictions**:

- Patient-visible support categories (admin cannot add or remove categories from the fixed list but may update labels in future)
- Content type visibility (admin can toggle content type visibility in FR-033 but cannot add new content types for patients)

  - **Source**: FR-034 Support Center & Ticketing System

---

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Patients will proactively check Help Center for answers before contacting support (requires clear navigation and discoverability)
- **Assumption 2**: Majority of patients will access Help Center from mobile devices (iOS/Android patient app)
- **Assumption 3**: Patients prefer self-service content (FAQs, tutorials) over contacting support for common questions
- **Assumption 4**: Patients will use the "Was this helpful?" feedback feature, providing data to improve content quality

### Technology Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Patients use smartphones with camera capabilities (for capturing screenshots to attach to support requests)
- **Assumption 2**: Patients have intermittent internet connectivity — cached Help Center content should be available offline where feasible
- **Assumption 3**: Patient app supports in-app video playback (embedded player for video tutorials)
- **Assumption 4**: Patient app supports in-app PDF/document preview for resource downloads

### Business Process Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Admin team responds to patient support cases within 24 hours during business hours (FR-034 SC-003)
- **Assumption 2**: Help Center content is curated to avoid medical advice and focus on platform usage, appointment management, and general information (FR-033 Assumption 5)
- **Assumption 3**: Emergency contact phone and email values are configured by admin before FR-035 goes live
- **Assumption 4**: Patient-visible support categories (8 categories) are sufficient for initial launch; admin will not need to add custom categories

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: FR-035 is a pure consumer of FR-033 content APIs and FR-034 ticketing APIs — it does not manage its own content or case data. All business logic for content management lives in FR-033, all case lifecycle logic lives in FR-034.
- **Caching**: Help Center content should be cached locally on the patient device to support offline browsing and reduce API load. Cache invalidation should respect the 1-minute content propagation SLA from FR-033.
- **Content Delivery**: Videos and large resources should be served via CDN for performance. Video streaming should support adaptive bitrate for variable network conditions.
- **Search**: Full-text search, relevance ordering, and inline suggestions are required for the patient Help Center MVP scope.

### Integration Points

- **Integration 1**: FR-033 Content API (Patient endpoint)
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with content type, title, body (rich text/HTML), metadata, media URLs
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens (patient session)
  - **Error handling**: Display cached content on API failure; show "temporarily unavailable" with retry for uncached content

- **Integration 2**: FR-034 Ticketing API (Patient endpoint)
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with case title, category, description, priority, attachments, patient ID
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens (patient session)
  - **Error handling**: Retry with exponential backoff on 5xx errors; queue submission locally if offline

- **Integration 3**: FR-020/S-03 Notification Service
  - **Data format**: Push notification and email payloads for case events
  - **Authentication**: System-to-system service authentication
  - **Error handling**: Notification delivery failures do not block case operations; retry asynchronously

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current scale**: Expected 500 Help Center page views per day and 50 support ticket submissions per day at launch
- **Growth projection**: Plan for 5,000 daily page views and 200 daily ticket submissions within 12 months
- **Peak load**: Handle 10x normal load during promotional campaigns or post-major-update support spikes
- **Data volume**: Help Center content is managed by admins (bounded); support case data grows linearly with patient base

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Patient must be authenticated to access Help Center content, submit support requests, and view tickets
- **Authorization**: Patients can only view their own support cases — no access to other patients' cases
- **Encryption**: All patient data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest; file attachments encrypted at rest
- **Audit trail**: All support case lifecycle events logged with timestamp, patient ID, and action type (managed by FR-034)
- **Threat mitigation**: Rate limiting on ticket submission and reply endpoints (max 10 submissions/hour/patient); file upload virus scanning; input sanitization for all text fields
- **Compliance**: Patient support data handling follows the same HIPAA/GDPR compliance requirements as all patient data in the platform

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Patient Finds Answer via Help Center (Priority: P1)

A patient who has questions about post-treatment hair care navigates to the Help Center from their Settings screen, browses the FAQs section, expands the relevant topic, and finds the answer they need — all without submitting a support ticket.

**Why this priority**: Self-service content access is the primary value proposition of the Help Center and the most common user journey. Deflecting support tickets directly reduces operational costs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to Help Center, browsing content types, viewing content detail, and submitting "Was this helpful?" feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a patient is on the Settings screen, **When** they tap "Help & Support", **Then** the Help & Support Hub (Screen 1) is displayed with search bar, Help Center link, Contact Support link, My Support Tickets link, and Emergency Contact section
2. **Given** a patient is on the Help & Support Hub, **When** they tap "Help Center", **Then** the Help Center Browser (Screen 2) is displayed with 4 content type cards (FAQs, Articles, Resources, Videos)
3. **Given** a patient selects the FAQs content type, **When** the FAQ list loads, **Then** FAQs are displayed in collapsible accordion sections organized by admin-defined topics (FR-033 REQ-033-006)
4. **Given** a patient reads an FAQ answer, **When** they tap "Yes" on "Was this helpful?", **Then** the system logs aggregated positive feedback and displays "Thank you for your feedback"

---

### User Story 2 - Patient Submits Support Request (Priority: P1)

A patient encountering a payment issue cannot find an answer in the Help Center, so they navigate to Contact Support, fill out the form with their issue details, and submit it. They receive a confirmation with a case ID and can immediately see their new ticket in My Support Tickets.

**Why this priority**: Support ticket submission is the core fallback when self-service fails. Without it, patients have no in-app support path, which is unacceptable for a healthcare platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a support request and verifying case creation in FR-034, confirmation display, and ticket appearance in My Support Tickets list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a patient is on the Help & Support Hub, **When** they tap "Contact Support", **Then** the Contact Support form (Screen 5) is displayed with title, category, description, priority, and attachment fields
2. **Given** a patient fills all required fields (title >= 10 chars, category selected, description >= 20 chars, priority selected), **When** they tap Submit, **Then** the system creates a support case in FR-034 with CASE-YYYY-##### ID, Ticket Source = "Patient App", Submitter Type = "Patient"
3. **Given** a support case is created successfully, **When** submission completes, **Then** the patient sees a confirmation screen with the Case ID and "We will respond within 24 hours", and is navigated to My Support Tickets (Screen 3)
4. **Given** a patient has submitted a support request, **When** they view My Support Tickets, **Then** the new ticket appears at the top with status "Open" and the submitted details

---

### User Story 3 - Patient Communicates with Admin via Ticket Thread (Priority: P2)

A patient who submitted a support request receives a notification that admin has replied. They open the ticket, read the admin's response, type a follow-up question, and send it — continuing the conversation thread.

**Why this priority**: Two-way communication is essential for resolving complex support issues. Without it, patients must rely on external email for follow-ups, breaking the in-app experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing an existing ticket with admin replies, sending a patient reply, and verifying the reply appears in the thread and admin is notified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a patient has a ticket with an admin reply, **When** they open the Ticket Detail (Screen 4), **Then** the communication thread shows all messages chronologically with sender labels ("You" / "Support Team") and timestamps
2. **Given** a patient is viewing a ticket with status Open or In Progress, **When** they type a reply and tap Send, **Then** the reply is added to the communication thread and the admin receives a support.case_user_reply notification
3. **Given** a patient is viewing a ticket with status Resolved, **When** they type and send a reply, **Then** the case automatically reopens to Open status, the status badge updates immediately, and the admin is notified

---

### User Story 4 - Patient Views Resolved Case with Auto-Closure (Priority: P2)

A patient's support case has been resolved by admin. The patient views the resolution summary, sees the auto-closure countdown, and decides whether to accept the resolution or reply to reopen the case.

**Why this priority**: The resolve-to-close lifecycle with auto-closure is critical for healthcare — patients must have a clear window to report recurring issues (e.g., post-treatment complications).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing a Resolved ticket showing resolution summary and auto-closure countdown, then either letting it auto-close or replying to reopen.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a patient has a ticket with status Resolved, **When** they open the Ticket Detail, **Then** they see the resolution summary above the thread and an auto-closure countdown ("This case will close in X days if no further reply")
2. **Given** a Resolved ticket's auto-closure period expires (7 days default), **When** the patient has not replied, **Then** the case automatically transitions to Closed and the patient receives a support.case_closed notification
3. **Given** a patient has a Closed ticket, **When** they open the Ticket Detail, **Then** the reply input is hidden and a Closed Case Banner is shown with options to create a new ticket or contact support to reopen

---

### User Story 5 - Patient Browses Video Tutorials and Downloads Resources (Priority: P3)

A patient preparing for their upcoming procedure browses the Help Center for educational content. They watch a video tutorial on post-treatment care and download a PDF guide for reference.

**Why this priority**: Rich content types (videos, resources) enhance the self-service experience but are secondary to core FAQ/article browsing and support ticket functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Videos content type, playing a video, navigating to Resources, and downloading a PDF.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a patient selects the Videos content type, **When** the video list loads, **Then** each video shows thumbnail, title, and duration
2. **Given** a patient taps a video, **When** the video detail loads, **Then** the embedded player plays the video with standard controls (play/pause, seek, fullscreen) and shows title, description, and transcript link
3. **Given** a patient selects the Resources content type and taps a resource, **When** the resource detail loads, **Then** a file preview is shown with a download button, and tapping download saves the file to the device

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a patient submits a support request while offline? System should queue the submission locally and submit when connectivity is restored, with clear indication to the patient.
- How does the system handle a patient who uploads a file that fails virus scanning? The file is rejected with a message: "This file could not be attached. Please try a different file." No details about the scan failure are exposed to the patient.
- What happens when a patient views Help Center with no published content (e.g., first launch before admin populates content)? Each content type card shows "No content available yet. Check back later or Contact Support."
- How does the system handle a patient deleting their account while support cases are active? Open/In Progress cases should be flagged for admin review; patient identity is anonymized per data retention policy (FR-023).
- What happens when the auto-closure countdown reaches 0 while the patient is actively viewing the ticket? The status should update to Closed in real-time and the reply input should be replaced with the Closed Case Banner.
