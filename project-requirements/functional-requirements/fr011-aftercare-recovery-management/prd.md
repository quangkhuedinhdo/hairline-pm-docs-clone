# FR-011 - Aftercare & Recovery Management

**Module**: P-05: Aftercare & Progress Monitoring | PR-04: Aftercare Participation *(elevated to P1 scope for FR-011 delivery)* | A-03: Aftercare Team Management  
**Feature Branch**: `fr011-aftercare-recovery-management`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: ✅ Verified & Approved  
**Source**: FR-011 from system-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Aftercare & Recovery Management module provides comprehensive post-procedure support for hair transplant patients through milestone-based tracking, scan monitoring, questionnaire assessments, and multi-tenant communication. The module supports both treatment-linked aftercare (for Hairline platform patients) and standalone aftercare services (for external clinic patients).

**Note on Scan Media (V1 vs V2)**: In V1, all references to "3D scans" in this FR refer to standardized head scan photo sets (multiple 2D views). True 3D scanning (ARKit/ARCore) is deferred to V2.

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-05)**: Aftercare & Progress Monitoring
- **Provider Platform (PR-04)**: Aftercare Participation (P1 scope for FR-011)
- **Admin Platform (A-03)**: Aftercare Team Management
- **Shared Services (S-XX)**: Notifications & Alerts, Media Storage, Payment (Standalone), Messaging/Communication (if enabled)

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

**Patient Platform (P-05)**:

- View aftercare dashboard (milestones, tasks, progress)
- Upload head scan photo sets per schedule *(V1; true 3D in V2)*; complete questionnaires; track medications
- Receive reminders and urgent alerts; contact aftercare team

**Provider Platform (PR-04)**:

- Review assigned aftercare cases and patient progress
- Configure/activate aftercare plans; customize milestones/medications/instructions
- Manage reschedules, escalations, and communications with aftercare team

**Admin Platform (A-03)**:

- Global oversight; case reassignment; plan overrides; escalations
- Template management (milestones, questionnaires, resources)
- Standalone aftercare request intake and assignment

**Shared Services (S-XX)**:

- Notifications & alerts; media storage for scans/documents
- Payment for standalone activation; secure messaging (if enabled)

### Communication Structure

**In Scope**:

- Patient ↔ Aftercare Team: Structured messaging, questionnaires, and scan/photo set submissions
- Provider ↔ Aftercare Team: Case updates and escalations
- Admin ↔ All Parties: Oversight and interventions
- System-generated updates: Milestone reminders, progress updates, urgent flags

**Out of Scope**:

- Direct patient ↔ provider chat (handled by FR-012 backlog)
- Payment flows beyond standalone activation (handled in Payment FR)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Treatment-Linked Setup & Activation (Priority: P1)

Why: Core path for Hairline-treated patients entering aftercare.

Independent Test: Provider completes treatment; selects template; activates plan; patient and aftercare team receive notifications.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given treatment completion, When provider selects and activates an aftercare template, Then patient dashboard and team assignment are created
2. Given activation, When notifications are sent, Then patient and assigned team receive activation messages
3. Given activation, When viewing patient dashboard, Then milestones, tasks, and schedule are visible

### User Story 2 - Patient Completes Milestone Tasks (Priority: P1)

Why: Ensures ongoing patient engagement and monitoring.

Independent Test: Patient receives reminders; uploads scan/photo set; completes questionnaire; progress updates; alerts generated if concerning.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given task due, When patient uploads scan meeting quality, Then task is completed and progress updates
2. Given concerning questionnaire responses, When submitted, Then case is flagged urgent and team notified
3. Given missed tasks, When overdue by 24 hours, Then status is Overdue and reminders/escalations trigger

### User Story 3 - Standalone Aftercare Onboarding (Priority: P2)

Why: Opens service to external clinic patients.

Independent Test: Patient requests standalone service, payment completes, admin assigns provider, provider activates plan.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given paid request, When admin assigns provider, Then provider configures and activates plan
2. Given activation, When patient opens app, Then aftercare dashboard is available with schedule

### Edge Cases

- Provider withdrawal: admin reassigns or cancels with reason; patient notified
- Network loss during scan upload: resumable upload; no duplicate entries
- Conflicting schedule changes: latest confirmed change supersedes prior; audit preserved
