# FR-020 - Notifications & Alerts

**Module**: S-03: Notification Service
**Feature Branch**: `fr020-notifications-alerts`
**Created**: 2025-11-11
**Status**: ✅ Verified & Approved
**Source**: FR-020 from local-docs/project-requirements/system-prd.md; Transcriptions (patient/admin/provider references)

## Executive Summary

Provide reliable, configurable notifications (email, push, optional SMS in future phases) for key lifecycle events across patients and providers. Deliver timely alerts, respect user preferences, prevent spam via throttling, and track delivery for operational visibility. MVP supports global Email/Push toggles on the patient app; fine‑grained category preferences follow in V2, and any SMS delivery is explicitly deferred beyond MVP.

---

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Patient Platform (FR-001: Patient Authentication & Profile Management): Receive push/email notifications; manage global Email/Push toggles (MVP) and view notification history (listing specified in FR-020).
- Provider Platform (FR-032: Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management / PR-06): Receive notifications for inquiries, quotes, bookings, payments, and messages; manage notification preferences; view notifications via dropdown.
- Admin Platform (FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration + FR-020 dropdown): Receive notifications for configurable events per FR-030 event catalog; configure default notification policies, SMS enablement, throttling thresholds, and view delivery dashboards; view notifications via dropdown.
- Affiliate Program (if enabled): Receive affiliate payout notifications; configuration is managed via FR-030 event catalog and rules.
- Shared Services (S-03): Unified Notification Service orchestrating channels (email, push, and SMS in future phases) with templates, throttling, and delivery tracking. SMS delivery is not implemented in MVP and is treated as a future enhancement.

### Scope Boundaries

In Scope:

- Notification event types (MVP):
  - **Source of truth**: `FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration` (Admin-Configurable Notification Event Catalog).
  - The table below mirrors FR-030 for completeness; **if any mismatch exists, FR-030 prevails**.

| Category | Event (Display Name) | Example Backend Event Key | Primary Recipients | Notes |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Account/Auth | Email Verification / OTP Code | `account.email_verification_code` | Patient, Provider, Admin | Extends FR-026 OTP templates; **security-critical** and non-disableable by default |

Fires when patient cancels inquiry in Inquiry, Quoted, or Accepted stages. Patient receives cancellation confirmation (mandatory — aligns with FR-003 Workflow 5 step 4 and Screen 8b). Cancellation reason is patient-private — provider notification says only "Inquiry cancelled by patient". **MVP default channels: Email + Push.** |
| Quote | Quote Submitted / Ready (Patient notified) | `quote.submitted` | Patient | Starts quote expiry timer (see below) |
| Quote | Quote Updated / Revised | `quote.updated` | Patient, Provider | Notify on meaningful changes (price/package/dates) |

- Channels: email, push; SMS is an optional/configurable channel for urgent events in the target architecture but is **not available in MVP** (no SMS notifications are sent until a later phase explicitly enables this capability).
- User preferences (MVP):
  - **Patients**: global Email/Push toggles (managed in FR-001: Patient Authentication & Profile Management, Settings → Notifications section); per‑category preferences deferred to V2 (not in scope).
  - **Providers**: can choose which notification types to receive (quote notifications, schedule notifications, treatment start notifications, aftercare notifications, review notifications, promotion/discount notifications) via notification preferences settings (managed in PR-06: Profile & Settings Management, Settings → Notifications section).
- Notification listing screens: patient notification history screen (full listing page), provider notification dropdown (infinite scroll), admin notification dropdown (infinite scroll).
- Throttling/de‑duplication and delivery tracking.

Out of Scope:

- In‑app messaging content design (covered in FR-012).
- Per‑category user preferences on patient app (explicitly V2).

### Entry Points

- System events published by core modules (inquiry, quote, booking, payment, chat, scheduling, aftercare) trigger notifications via S-03.
- Users access Settings → Notifications to set global Email/Push toggles (MVP).

---

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Event → Notification Dispatch

Actors: System, Notification Service, Recipient
Trigger: Business event occurs (e.g., booking confirmed)
Outcome: Recipient receives notification according to channel preferences

Steps:

1. Event emitted with payload (type, actor, subject, recipient id).
2. Notification Service evaluates preferences and throttling.
3. Builds message from template and routes to enabled channels.
4. Records delivery attempt and status; exposes audit.
5. (If SMS enabled and urgent) include SMS path; else email/push only.

### Alternative Flows

- A1: Preference Disabled
  - Trigger: Recipient has disabled Email or Push.
  - Outcome: Channel suppressed; delivery attempted on remaining enabled channels.

- B1: Throttling
  - Trigger: Excessive events in short time window.
  - Outcome: Coalesce or defer per policy; record suppression in audit.

- B2: Channel Failure
  - Trigger: Email/push/SMS provider unavailable.
  - Outcome: Retry with backoff; failover when configured; status reflects failure cause.

Notification policy, throttling, and delivery monitoring UI live in `FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration` (including template editor; OTP templates in `FR-026`). FR-020 depends on those capabilities and does not re-specify the admin screen.

---

### Consolidated Screen Notes

- Patient – Notification Listing: Patient App → Notifications (dedicated tab or menu item); notifications persist for 90 days then archive.
- Provider – Notification Dropdown: Provider dashboard header bell icon; real-time updates (WebSocket or polling); infinite scroll within dropdown at max height.
- Admin – Notification Dropdown: Admin dashboard header bell icon; real-time updates (WebSocket or polling); infinite scroll within dropdown at max height; critical items pinned above non-critical.
- Patient notification settings: Owned by `FR-001: Patient Authentication & Profile Management` (Settings → Notifications).
- Provider notification settings: Owned by `FR-032: Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management (PR-06)` (Settings → Notifications).
- Admin policy/config screens: Owned by `FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration` (template editor) and `FR-026: App Settings & Security Policies` (OTP templates).

## Success Criteria

- SC-001: 95% of eligible events generate a notification without violating platform performance NFRs (API p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1000ms), and users typically see notifications within ~2 seconds under normal load.
- SC-002: 99% of notifications respect user global Email/Push preferences.
- SC-003: Throttling reduces duplicate notifications by ≥ 90% during spikes.
- SC-004: Delivery status recorded for 100% of attempts.
- SC-005: Notification Settings loads in ≤ 1 second (p95).

---

## Business Rules

- **Patient Preferences**: Global Email/Push toggles available to patients in MVP (managed in FR-001: Patient Authentication & Profile Management, Settings → Notifications); category preferences deferred to V2.
- **Provider Preferences**: Providers can choose which notification types to receive (quote notifications, schedule notifications, treatment start notifications, aftercare notifications, review notifications, promotion/discount notifications) via notification preferences settings (managed in FR-032: Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management, Settings → Notifications section).
- **Admin Notifications**: Admin recipients and event coverage are defined by the FR-030 event catalog and configured rules (no additional hard-coded admin event list in FR-020).
- One notification record per attempt with channel, provider, status, and timestamp.
- Throttling and suppression policies are transparent in audit logs.
- **Notification Content Management**: Notification content (titles, messages, templates) is managed in FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration via the Notification Template Editor.
- **Email Template Management**:
  - General notification email templates: Managed in FR-030 (Notification Rules & Configuration) with support for dynamic variables, multi-language content, rich text formatting, and preview capabilities.
  - OTP email templates (verification, password reset): Managed in FR-026 (App Settings & Security Policies) as part of authentication settings.

### Admin Editability

Editable by Admin:

- Throttling thresholds, SMS enablement, default channel policies, templates.

Fixed in Codebase (Not Editable):

- Supported channels (Email/Push; SMS behind config), baseline event types per FR-030 event catalog.

Configurable with Restrictions:

- Maximum SMS volume, high‑priority categories allowed for SMS.

---

## Dependencies

- **FR-001**: Patient Authentication & Profile Management (patient notification preferences UI in Settings → Notifications).
- **FR-012**: Messaging (message received events).
- **FR-026**: App Settings & Security Policies (OTP email templates for verification and password reset).
- **FR-030**: Notification Rules & Configuration (notification template management, template editor, notification rule configuration).
- **FR-032**: Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management (PR-06; provider notification preferences UI).
- P-02/P-03/P-05 events for inquiry/quote/booking/aftercare milestones.
- S-03 Notification Service; Email/Push/SMS providers via configured adapters.

---

## Assumptions

- Users understand global Email/Push toggles; granular controls to be introduced later.
- SMS costs are controlled via caps; only urgent categories use SMS.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Event-driven design; idempotent handlers; retries with backoff.
- Delivery provider abstraction; per-channel template library.
- Privacy: no sensitive content in notifications; deep links use secure tokens.
- **Notification Content Management**: Notification templates (email, push, SMS) are managed in FR-030: Notification Rules & Configuration via the Notification Template Editor, which supports dynamic variables, multi-language content, rich text formatting (email), and preview capabilities.
- **Email Template Management**:
  - General notification email templates: Managed in FR-030 (Notification Rules & Configuration) - admins can create/edit templates per event type and channel with variable substitution, multi-language support, and preview.
  - OTP email templates: Managed separately in FR-026 (App Settings & Security Policies) for email verification and password reset flows.
- **Notification Preferences**:
  - Patient preferences: Managed in FR-001 (Patient Authentication & Profile Management) under Settings → Notifications screen.
  - Provider preferences: Managed in FR-032 (Provider Dashboard Settings & Profile Management) under Settings → Notifications section (providers can toggle individual notification types on/off: quote notifications, schedule notifications, treatment start notifications, aftercare notifications, review notifications, promotion/discount notifications).

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 – Patient toggles preferences (P1)

Why: Respect user choice on communication channels.

Independent Test: Disable Email and verify only Push is delivered for eligible events.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given Email is disabled, when an event fires, then no email is sent and push is delivered (if enabled).
2. Given both Email and Push disabled, when an event fires, then no notification is sent and suppression is logged.

### User Story 2 – Admin enables SMS for urgent events (P2)

Why: Ensure urgent communication reaches users reliably.

Independent Test: Mark “appointment reminder” as SMS‑eligible; verify SMS sent under policy.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given SMS is enabled for urgent reminders, when a reminder event fires, then an SMS is sent and logged.
2. Given SMS volume cap reached, when more SMS would be sent, then they are suppressed and recorded.

### User Story 3 – Spike throttling (P2)

Why: Avoid spamming users during bursts.

Independent Test: Simulate high‑frequency message events; ensure de‑duplication.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given many identical events in a short window, when throttling applies, then only coalesced notifications are sent.
2. Given throttling suppressed some events, when admin reviews logs, then suppression entries are visible.

### User Story 4 – Cancellation notification delivery (P1)

Why: Inquiry cancellation triggers mandatory notifications to patient (confirmation) and affected providers (cascade). Privacy rules must be enforced — provider must not see patient's cancellation reason.

Independent Test: Patient cancels inquiry with 2 active quotes; verify patient receives confirmation via email + push; both providers receive `quote.cancelled_inquiry` via email + push with privacy-compliant content; admin receives optional `inquiry.cancelled` if enabled.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given patient cancels inquiry with 2 active quotes, when cancellation completes, then patient receives `inquiry.cancelled` notification via both email and push within 5 minutes confirming cancellation with reason visible.
2. Given patient cancels inquiry, when providers receive `quote.cancelled_inquiry` notification, then notification says "Inquiry cancelled by patient" without revealing the patient's cancellation reason.
3. Given provider has disabled quote notifications in FR-032 preferences, when inquiry is cancelled, then `quote.cancelled_inquiry` notification is suppressed for that provider and suppression is logged in audit.
4. Given patient has disabled push notifications (email only), when inquiry is cancelled, then patient receives `inquiry.cancelled` via email only; push is suppressed per preference.
