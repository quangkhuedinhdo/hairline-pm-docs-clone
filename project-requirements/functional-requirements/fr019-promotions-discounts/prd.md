## Executive Summary

Define, approve, and apply discounts across the Hairline platform with clear governance and auditability. Admins can create platform‑wide promotions (including those that affect both provider and Hairline fees), while providers can create their own discounts. The system validates codes at quote and booking, enforces usage limits and prioritization rules, and tracks usage and financial impact. This increases conversion while safeguarding provider margins and Hairline commission through an approval workflow and transparent reporting.

---

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Patient Platform (P-03 overlay): See applied discount summary in quote/booking flows; enter a discount code when enabled; view final price breakdown.
- Provider Platform (PR-02/PR-05): Create provider-specific discounts; review and accept/decline platform discounts; see eligible discounts during quote creation; view discount impact in reports.
- Admin Platform (A-06): Create and manage platform discounts (platform‑only or both‑fees), configure categories, dates, limits, and code rules; manage approvals and track usage; view financial impact.
- Shared Services (S-03, S-02): Notification Service for approval and status alerts; Payment/Financial service for price calculation and settlement alignment.

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

Patient Platform (P-03 overlay):

- Input discount code (if allowed at stage), see validation feedback.
- See discounted totals and savings; understand that only one discount applies.

Provider Platform (PR-02/PR-05):

- Create provider discounts with type (percent/fixed/package upgrade), dates, limits.
- Accept/decline platform both‑fees discounts per program; auto‑active provider‑only discounts.
- Select applicable approved discounts within quote creation (where rules allow).

Admin Platform (A-06):

- Create platform discounts: platform‑only, both‑fees, and Hairline‑only.
- Configure targets (all providers or subsets), dates, usage caps, stackability policy (single‑discount rule enforced globally).
- Manage approval workflow for both‑fees discounts; monitor provider responses.
- Track usage and financial impact with exports.

Shared Services (S-03, S-02):

- S-03 sends provider approval notifications and status updates.
- S-02 ensures correct price calculation and settlement attribution.

### Scope Boundaries

In Scope:

- Discount code definition and lifecycle (draft → active → expired), with usage limits and date windows.
- Discount validation and application at quote and booking; one discount per booking.
- Provider approval workflow for platform both‑fees discounts.
- Usage tracking and financial impact reporting.

Out of Scope:

- Stacking multiple discounts on a single booking (explicitly disallowed).
- Loyalty points and referral rewards (covered elsewhere).
- Tax/VAT calculation changes (handled by billing/finance rules).

### Entry Points

- Admin creates a platform discount in A-06; if both‑fees, providers receive approval requests.
- Provider creates a provider discount in PR-02/PR-05; becomes active per dates/limits.
- Patient enters a code (if enabled) at quote/booking; system validates and applies if eligible.

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Admin Creates Platform Discount (Both‑Fees)

Actors: Admin, Provider, System
Trigger: Admin submits a new platform discount that affects both fees
Outcome: Providers approve participation; discount becomes selectable where applicable

Steps:

1. Admin defines discount (type, value, dates, usage limit, targeted providers).
2. System saves discount as Pending Approval and notifies targeted providers.
3. Providers accept or decline; system logs responses.
4. When provider accepts, discount becomes eligible for that provider’s quotes during active window.
5. System tracks usage and financial impact per provider.

### Alternative Flows

**A1: Provider‑Only Discount**:

- Trigger: Provider creates their own discount.
- Steps: System validates inputs and activates per dates/limits; no approval needed.
- Outcome: Discount immediately eligible in provider’s quote creation.

**A2: Hairline‑Only Discount**:

- Trigger: Admin creates Hairline‑funded discount (commission only).
- Steps: System applies financial impact to Hairline share only; not visible to providers in selection UIs.
- Outcome: Booking reflects reduced platform commission; providers unaffected.

**B1: Code Validation Failure**:

- Trigger: Patient/provider enters invalid/expired/reached‑limit code.
- Steps: System returns reason; prevents application.
- Outcome: No discount applied; user can retry.

**B2: Single‑Discount Rule Conflict**:

- Trigger: Attempt to apply a code when a discount is already applied.
- Steps: System blocks stacking; prompts user to choose one.
- Outcome: Exactly one discount per booking.

## Screen Specifications

### Screen 1: Admin – Create/Manage Discount

Purpose: Let admins define and manage platform discounts with approval workflow.

Data Fields:

| Field Name       | Type        | Required | Description                                  | Validation Rules                 |

| Price breakdown | panel | Yes      | Base price, discount, totals         | Must reflect applied rules            |

Business Rules:

- One discount per booking; entering a new code replaces the current one after confirmation.
- Validation occurs both at quote and booking confirmation.

Notes:

- Clear feedback for invalid/expired/limit‑reached codes.

---

### Screen 4: Admin – Discount Code Catalog

**Purpose**: Admin searches for and filters all discount codes (platform-created and provider-created) across the platform.

This screen is the operational catalog view for existing discount codes. **FR-022** remains the authoritative source for the search/filter criteria; this FR defines the result layout, row actions, and acceptance behavior for the A-06 screen.

**Data Fields**:

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description | Validation Rules |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Code / keyword search | text input | No | Search by discount code text or keyword | Min 2 chars; 500ms debounce; case-insensitive fuzzy match |
| Filter: Status | multi-select | No | Filter by discount lifecycle status | Options: Active, Draft, Expired, Paused; OR within field |
| Filter: Provider Participation | dropdown | No | Filter by participating provider | All; provider list from DB; exact match |
| Filter: Date Range | date range picker | No | Filter by active window | Start/end overlap with discount active window |
| Filter: Usage | range | No | Filter by redeemed count / utilization threshold | Min–Max range; blank defaults to unbounded |
| Filter: ROI | dropdown | No | Filter by ROI tier or performance band | Admin-defined tiers; exact match |
| Result Count | label | Yes | Shows number of matched discount codes | Updates after every search/filter operation |
| Results Table | table | Yes | Displays matched discount codes for review and action | Columns are fixed for MVP and must render all required fields below |

**Results Table Columns**:

| Column | Source / Meaning | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Code | Discount code text | Primary identifier; searchable |
| Discount Owner | Platform-created or provider-created | Shows owner badge and provider name when applicable |
| Funding Model | Platform only / Both fees / Hairline only / Provider only | Derived from discount definition |
| Participating Providers | Provider scope summary | Shows `All Providers` or explicit provider count/name summary |
| Status | Draft / Active / Paused / Expired | Derived from lifecycle state |
| Active Window | Start and end dates | Used by Date Range filter |
| Usage | Redeemed count versus limit | Shows current count and cap when capped |
| ROI Tier | Admin-defined ROI band | Blank states shown as `Not yet calculated` until ROI data exists |
| Last Updated | Most recent admin/provider mutation timestamp | Default descending sort key for the list |

**Business Rules**:

- Admin can view all platform-created and provider-created discount codes in one unified list.
- Catalog rows must always display the discount owner and funding model so admins can distinguish provider-created versus platform-created discounts without opening the detail flow.
- Provider Participation filter matches the provider scope configured on the discount: `All Providers` rows are returned only when the filter is `All`, while provider-specific rows require an exact provider match.
- Date Range filter uses active-window overlap logic; a discount is included when any part of its active window overlaps the selected range.
- Usage filter evaluates redeemed count, not available balance or estimated reach.
- ROI filter uses the same admin-defined ROI tiering rules referenced in FR-022; rows without computed ROI remain visible only when ROI filter is `All`.
- Search, filters, result count, and reset behavior must stay aligned with FR-022 control standards.
- Access restricted to authorized admin roles (RBAC enforced per FR-031).

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Given the admin opens the Discount Code Catalog, when the screen loads, then the system shows the unified discount list with the fixed MVP columns defined above and the result count for the default query.
2. Given the admin enters a code or keyword query, when the debounce completes, then the list narrows to matching discount rows using case-insensitive fuzzy matching.
3. Given the admin applies any combination of Status, Provider Participation, Date Range, Usage, and ROI filters, when the filters are active, then the catalog returns only rows satisfying all active filter types and updates the result count.
4. Given the admin clears all active filters, when reset is triggered, then all controls return to defaults and the full catalog list is restored.
5. Given the admin needs more detail on a matched code, when they select a row, then the system opens the existing create/manage detail flow for that discount without losing the active catalog context.

**Notes**:

- Search and filter field definitions are co-owned with FR-022. Any change to search/filter criteria on this screen must be updated in both FR-019 and FR-022.
- Row-level actions (pause, resume, edit, archive) must follow the permissions and audit rules defined for Screen 1.

---

## Business Rules

### General Module Rules

- Single‑discount rule enforced globally (patient code > provider code > affiliate code priority when conflicts arise).
- Usage limits and active dates are enforced at validation time.
- All discount creations, approvals, applications, and removals are auditable.

### Data & Privacy Rules

- Display only non‑sensitive discount info to patients; provider/Hairline cost splits remain internal.
- Financial records and discount artifacts retained for ≥ 7 years; takedowns handled by archival, not deletion.
- Access governed by RBAC; only authorized roles can create/approve/apply discounts beyond self‑service code entry.

### Admin Editability Rules

Editable by Admin:

- Discount categories, code format policy, max value caps, and campaign dates.
- Targeting rules (all providers vs. subsets) and approval routing.
- Notification templates for approvals and status.

Fixed in Codebase (Not Editable):

- Single‑discount rule and priority order.
- Calculation order of operations (base → discounts → taxes/fees).

Configurable with Restrictions:

- Max discount value thresholds per policy and region.
- Auto‑decline window for unresponded provider approvals.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies (Other FRs/Modules)

- PR-02: Inquiry & Quote Management – discount selection during quote creation.
- P-03: Booking & Payment – validate/apply discount at booking and settlement.
- A-05: Billing & Financial Reconciliation – reflect Hairline vs provider shares.
- S-03: Notification Service – provider approvals and status updates.
- S-02: Payment/Financial Service – price calculation and settlement.

### External Dependencies (APIs, Services)

- Email/Push providers (via S-03) for approval/status notifications.

### Data Dependencies

- Provider catalog and identifiers for targeting.
- Booking/quote entities with price components for calculation.

---

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- Providers respond to approval requests within 3 business days.
- Patients will attempt code entry primarily during quote review.

### Technology Assumptions

- Quote and booking flows expose a single code input surface.
- Calculation service supports deterministic rounding and currency rules.

### Business Process Assumptions

- Finance defines regional caps and policy; legal approves terms for promotions.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- Calculation pipeline: base price → discount (single) → taxes/fees; idempotent validation.
- Prevent race conditions across quote/booking with atomic application and revalidation on booking.
- Audit trail for all state changes; soft‑disable discounts without data loss.

### Integration Points

- Admin UI ↔ Promotion service: CRUD, approvals, targeting.
- Provider UI ↔ Promotion service: approvals, provider discounts.
- Quote/Booking ↔ Calculation service: validate/apply discount.

### Scalability Considerations

- Cache active discounts and targeting; invalidate on updates.
- Paginated usage reports; background generation for long ranges.

### Security Considerations

- RBAC on creation/approval/application; input validation on codes and values.
- Encryption in transit/at rest; audit logs tamper‑resistant.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 – Admin launches both‑fees discount (P1)

Why: Increase conversion for a campaign spanning multiple providers.

Independent Test: Create both‑fees discount, providers approve, discount appears in eligible quotes.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a new both‑fees discount, when saved, then targeted providers receive approval requests.
2. Given a provider approves, when a quote is created in active window, then the discount is selectable.

### User Story 2 – Provider creates own discount (P1)

Why: Allow providers to run targeted promotions without admin approval.

Independent Test: Provider creates discount; it appears in their quote creation and validates.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a provider discount, when dates start, then the discount is available for selection.
2. Given usage limit is reached, when applied, then validation fails with clear reason.

### User Story 3 – Patient applies code at booking (P2)

Why: Ensure final price uses a single validated discount.

Independent Test: Enter valid code at booking; total updates and audit entry recorded.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a valid code, when applied at booking, then totals update and audit records exist.
2. Given another code is entered while one is active, when confirmed, then the new code replaces the old one.

### Edge Cases

- Ineligible/expired/limit‑reached codes: validation fails with reason.
- Simultaneous attempts to apply codes: last confirmed selection wins; audit both attempts.
- Provider fails to respond to approval: auto‑decline after policy window; visible in audit.
