## Executive Summary

The Help Centre Content Management module provides a centralized knowledge base and support system for both provider and patient platforms. This feature enables Hairline admins to create, organize, and maintain comprehensive help documentation that providers and patients can access for self-service support, reducing support ticket volume and improving user efficiency across all platform tenants.

**Key Objectives**:

- Provide providers and patients with 24/7 access to self-service help resources
- Reduce support ticket volume by enabling users to find answers independently
- Enable admins to centrally manage and update help content for TWO distinct audiences: Providers and Patients
- Maintain separate content repositories for provider-facing and patient-facing content to prevent cross-contamination
- Maintain a canonical Help Centre taxonomy (categories, ordering, visibility) aligned with `system-prd.md` and tenant UX (FR-032 / FR-035)
- Support scalable content organization with multi-category structure for each audience
- Maintain content consistency and quality through admin-controlled publishing workflow

## Business Rules

### General Module Rules

- **Rule 2**: Only admins can create, edit, or delete Help Centre content; providers and patients have read-only access to their respective content
- **Rule 3**: Content must be tagged with audience type (Provider or Patient) and assigned to exactly one of the predefined categories for that audience

- **Rule 7**: Admin must explicitly select audience (Provider or Patient) when creating content; content cannot be shared across audiences without manual re-creation

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies (Other FRs/Modules)

- **FR-032 / Module PR-06**: Provider Help Centre accessed from provider settings page
  - **Why needed**: Help Centre menu item appears in provider platform navigation, linked from FR-032 profile & settings module
  - **Integration point**: Help Centre navigation menu item added to provider platform sidebar, accessible from settings page; displays provider-specific Help Centre content

- **FR-035 / Module P-08**: Patient Help Centre accessed from patient app
  - **Why needed**: Patient Help Centre provides read-only access to patient-specific Help Centre content managed in FR-033
  - **Integration point**: Patient app fetches patient-specific Help Centre content via REST API; displays patient-facing FAQs, articles, resources, and videos (no Service Status)

- **FR-031 / Module A-09**: Admin access control for Help Centre management
  - **Why needed**: Help Centre management requires admin role permissions to create, edit, publish content for both provider and patient audiences
  - **Integration point**: Admin platform role-based permissions control access to Help Centre management features across both content repositories

- **FR-009 / Module PR-01**: Provider team member access to Help Centre
  - **Why needed**: All provider staff (regardless of role) should be able to access provider Help Centre for support
  - **Integration point**: Help Centre accessible to all provider roles defined in FR-009 (Owner, Manager, Clinical Staff, Billing Staff)

- **FR-034 / Module A-10**: Support Center & Ticketing for all submissions
  - **Why needed**: Provider submissions via Help Centre Contact Support form (FR-032 Screen 5.5) and Feedback & Suggestions form (FR-032 Screen 5.6), and patient submissions via FR-035, are managed through FR-034 Support Center & Ticketing system, not within FR-033
  - **Integration point**: All submissions from Help Centre forms automatically create support cases in FR-034; FR-033 provides read-only Help Centre content only, while FR-034 handles all support ticket and feedback case management for both providers and patients

### External Dependencies (APIs, Services)

- **External Service 1**: Media Storage Service (S-05)
  - **Purpose**: Store uploaded tutorial guides, videos, images, PDF documents
  - **Integration**: RESTful API calls for file upload, retrieval, deletion

- **Assumption 2**: Help Centre content reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure accuracy and relevance across both audiences
- **Assumption 3**: Support team monitors feedback submissions and content gaps to prioritize new content creation for both providers and patients
- **Assumption 4**: Service status updates managed by Hairline technical operations team with real-time incident updates during outages (provider-only feature)
- **Assumption 5**: Patient content will be curated to avoid medical advice and focus on platform usage, appointment management, and general information

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Help Centre content stored in relational database with separate tables/repositories for provider and patient content; shared media storage for files; content served via web API with caching layer for frequently accessed content
- **Content Management**: Use headless CMS architecture to separate content management (admin) from content presentation (provider platform and patient app); admin UI clearly distinguishes between provider and patient content repositories
- **Multi-Tenant Separation**: Provider content and patient content completely separated at database level to prevent cross-audience data exposure; separate API endpoints for provider content (/api/provider/help-centre) and patient content (/api/patient/help-centre)
- **File Storage**: Large files (videos, PDFs) stored in cloud object storage (S3, Azure Blob) with CDN for fast global delivery; files tagged with audience type (provider/patient) for access control
- **Performance**: Implement aggressive caching for published Help Centre content (cache invalidation on content updates); pre-generate content indexes for fast category/tag filtering per audience; patient content cached more aggressively due to higher expected traffic
- **Search**: Full-text search across all content (title, body, tags) is required for P1 and scoped to the selected audience (provider or patient). Database full-text indexing is the minimum implementation baseline; a dedicated search engine remains an optional later enhancement.

### Integration Points

- **Integration 1**: Provider platform fetches provider-specific Help Centre content via REST API
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with content metadata (title, category, type, publish date, audience: "provider") and content body (HTML)
  - **Authentication**: Provider platform uses authenticated API calls with provider session token
  - **Error handling**: If API unavailable, display cached content or "Help Centre temporarily unavailable" message; retry API call on next page load
  - **Endpoint**: GET /api/provider/help-centre (returns provider content only)

- **Integration 2**: Patient app fetches patient-specific Help Centre content via REST API
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with content metadata (title, category, type, publish date, audience: "patient") and content body (HTML)
  - **Authentication**: Patient app uses authenticated API calls with patient session token
  - **Error handling**: If API unavailable, display cached content or "Help Centre temporarily unavailable" message; retry API call on next page load
  - **Endpoint**: GET /api/patient/help-centre (returns patient content only, excludes Service Status)

- **Integration 3**: Admin platform manages Help Centre content for both audiences via REST API with rich text editor
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with content metadata (including audience: "provider" or "patient") and HTML content body; file uploads via multipart form data
  - **Authentication**: Admin platform uses authenticated API calls with admin session token and permission verification
  - **Error handling**: If API unavailable, queue content changes locally and sync when API available; notify admin of sync failures
  - **Endpoints**: POST /api/admin/help-centre (create content), PUT /api/admin/help-centre/:id (update), DELETE /api/admin/help-centre/:id (archive)

- **Integration 4**: Media storage service (S-05) stores uploaded files for both audiences
  - **Data format**: Binary file upload with metadata (file name, size, content type, associated content ID, audience type)
  - **Authentication**: Signed upload URLs or API key authentication
  - **Error handling**: If upload fails, retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts); if all retries fail, notify admin and save content as draft

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current scale**: Expect 200 Help Centre content items at launch (100 provider content items + 100 patient content items; 50 FAQs + 30 guides + 20 videos per audience)
- **Growth projection**: Plan for 1000+ content items within 12 months as platform features expand and user base grows (500 provider + 500 patient)
- **Peak load**: Handle 500 concurrent provider accesses and 5000 concurrent patient accesses to Help Centre during major feature launches or platform incidents
- **Data volume**: Expect 20GB media storage for videos and PDFs within first year (200 videos @ 50MB average, 400 PDFs @ 5MB average across both audiences)
- **Scaling strategy**: Horizontal scaling of web servers serving Help Centre API; CDN for media file delivery; database read replicas for content queries; cache layer (Redis/Memcached) for frequently accessed content with separate cache namespaces for provider and patient content

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Help Centre content accessible only to authenticated users (providers and patients access their respective content); admin content management accessible only to authenticated admin users with Help Centre management permissions
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control enforced at API level (providers: read-only provider content, patients: read-only patient content, admins: read-write both content repositories based on permissions)
- **Audience Separation**: Providers cannot access patient content; patients cannot access provider content; API endpoints enforce audience-based access control to prevent cross-audience data exposure
- **File Upload Security**: All uploaded files scanned for viruses before storage; file type validation (whitelist: PDF, MP4, MOV, JPG, PNG); file size limits enforced; uploaded files stored outside web root with access-controlled URLs; files tagged with audience type for access control
- **Content Injection**: Rich text editor sanitizes HTML input to prevent XSS attacks; strip dangerous tags (script, iframe) before saving; use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- **Audit trail**: All content changes logged with admin identity, timestamp, IP address, audience type, and action for security audit compliance
- **Data Privacy**: User feedback on content (helpfulness ratings) logged with user identity for analytics but not publicly displayed; support requests encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
