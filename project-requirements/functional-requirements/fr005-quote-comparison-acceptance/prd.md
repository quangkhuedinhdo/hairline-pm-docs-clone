## Executive Summary

The Quote Comparison & Acceptance module enables patients to review all provider quotes received for a submitted inquiry, compare details (treatment, dates, pricing, inclusions), and accept exactly one quote to proceed. Acceptance transitions the case from Quoted to Accepted and prepares the handoff to the subsequent Booking & Payment module. This module maintains strict privacy rules: provider access to patient full identity remains restricted until successful payment confirmation. The module preserves full auditability, honors quote expirations, and ensures non-selected quotes are automatically cancelled with appropriate notifications.

---

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-02)**: Quote Request & Management  
- **Provider Platform (PR-02)**: Inquiry & Quote Management  
- **Admin Platform (A-01)**: Patient Management & Oversight  
- **Shared Services (S-03, S-06)**: Notification service, audit logging, retention/archival utilities

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

**Patient Platform (P-02)**:

- View all quotes per inquiry within the Inquiry Dashboard (FR-003 Screen 8).  
- Inspect quote details via FR-004's patient quote detail screen (Screen 4) with added Accept functionality.  
- Accept exactly one quote (acceptance auto-cancels all other quotes for the same inquiry); see countdown to expiry.  
- Receive notifications for quote updates, expiries, and acceptance confirmation.  
- After acceptance, proceed to booking/payment flow entry point (next FR).

**Provider Platform (PR-02)**:

- Read-only visibility of acceptance outcome for their quotes.  
- Non-selected quotes auto-cancelled with reason “Other quote accepted”.  
- No patient PII is revealed by acceptance; full details remain locked until payment confirmation per constitution.

**Admin Platform (A-01)**:

- Global oversight of quote states and acceptance events across patients/providers.  
- Soft-delete/restore capabilities with audit trail.  
- Conflict resolution (rare): e.g., simultaneous accept attempts; manual remediation with rationale.

**Shared Services (S-03, S-06)**:

- Notifications for acceptance/expiry events and auto-cancellation of non-selected quotes.  
- Audit logging service for all state transitions.  
- Retention/archival utilities (soft delete only; no hard deletes).

### Communication Structure

**In Scope**:

- System → Patient: Quote update/expiry/acceptance notifications.  
- Patient → System: Accept action on eligible quotes (acceptance auto-cancels all other quotes).  
- Patient → Hairline Support: Ask questions about quotes via secure messaging (see FR-012; MVP channel: Patient ↔ Hairline Support).  
- System → Hairline Support: Notify support of patient quote questions within 5 minutes.  
- System → Provider: Acceptance outcome and auto-cancellation updates for non-selected quotes.  
- Admin → All: Oversight and policy-bound interventions.

**Out of Scope**:

- Direct patient-provider chat (see FR-012: Messaging & Communication).  
- Payment collection and invoice issuance (handled in Booking & Payment FR).  
- Revealing patient contact/identity to provider prior to payment confirmation.

### Entry Points

- Patient accesses from Inquiry Dashboard (FR-003 Screen 8) where quotes are displayed within the inquiry context, or via push/email notification.  
- Acceptance is available only while the target quote is non-expired and not withdrawn.  
- Upon acceptance, system locks competing quotes for the same inquiry and triggers booking handoff.

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Patient Accepts a Quote

**Actors**: Patient, System, Provider (notified), Admin (observer)
**Trigger**: Patient taps “Accept” on a valid, unexpired quote
**Outcome**: Inquiry transitions to Accepted; competing quotes auto-cancelled; booking handoff prepared

**Steps**:

1. Patient opens Inquiry Dashboard (FR-003 Screen 8) and views received quotes within the inquiry context.  
2. Patient taps "View Details" on a quote to open FR-004's patient quote detail screen (Screen 4).  
3. Patient reviews full quote details and taps "Accept" button (FR-005 enhancement to FR-004 Screen 4).  
4. Patient confirms acceptance with terms acknowledgment and summary confirmation modal.  
5. System validates eligibility (not expired, no prior acceptance for this inquiry).  
6. System sets chosen quote status to Accepted and inquiry stage to Accepted.  
7. System auto-cancels all other quotes for the same inquiry with reason "Other quote accepted."  
8. System sends notifications to patient and all affected providers.  
9. System prepares booking/payment handoff metadata to the next module (no payment collected here).  
10. System writes immutable audit entries for all state changes.

### Alternative Flows

**A1: Quote Expires During Review**:

- Trigger: Countdown reaches zero while patient is viewing details.  
- Steps: System disables Accept button; shows “Expired” badge and guidance to choose another quote.  
- Outcome: Patient can pick another available (non-expired) quote for the same inquiry if one exists. If all quotes have expired, the patient may cancel the inquiry and submit a new one, or contact support.

**A2: Simultaneous Acceptance Attempt**:

- Trigger: Patient attempts to accept a second quote after already accepting another (or after a race condition).  
- Steps: System prevents second acceptance; shows message referencing accepted quote.  
- Outcome: Exactly one accepted quote per inquiry is enforced.

**A3: Provider Withdraws Before Acceptance Completes**:

- Trigger: Provider withdraws quote just before patient confirms acceptance.
- Steps: System re-validates eligibility at confirmation; if withdrawn, acceptance is blocked with explanation.
- Outcome: Patient returns to inquiry dashboard to select another quote.

**A4: Patient Cancels Inquiry During Quote Review**:

- Trigger: Patient cancels the parent inquiry (FR-003 Workflow 5) while quotes are available for review or one is already accepted.
- Steps: System cancels inquiry; all quotes auto-cancelled with status "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)"; all Accept/Compare actions disabled; dashboard shows "Cancelled" badge. If in Accepted stage with 48-hour appointment slot hold active, hold is released immediately (see FR-006).
- Outcome: Inquiry dashboard becomes read-only. Patient can create a new inquiry immediately.

## Business Rules

### General Module Rules

1. A patient can accept exactly one quote per inquiry; subsequent acceptance attempts are blocked with guidance.  
2. Acceptance of one quote auto-cancels all competing quotes for the same inquiry with clear reasons and notifications.  
3. Acceptance does not reveal patient full identity to provider; full PII becomes accessible only after successful payment confirmation, per constitution.  
4. All acceptance-related state transitions are immutably audited (who, when, what, reason).  
5. Quotes that are expired, withdrawn, or archived are ineligible for acceptance.  
6. All deletes are soft deletes; no hard deletes permitted.
7. Notifications sent to non-selected providers (due to auto-cancellation) MUST NOT reveal the identity of the selected provider or the accepted price.

### Data & Privacy Rules

1. Patient identifiers remain anonymized to providers at this stage.  
2. All data in transit and at rest is protected according to platform policies.  
3. Audit logs must record acceptance event details and affected quotes.  
4. Retention: acceptance and related quote records retained ≥ 7 years.

### Admin Editability Rules

**Editable by Admin**:

- Resolve rare conflicts (e.g., simultaneous accept attempts) with reason.  
- Soft delete/restore acceptance records and quotes with justification (audited).  
- Configure notification behaviors via centralized settings (separate FR).

**Fixed in Codebase (Not Editable)**:

- Patient identity reveal policy: only post-payment confirmation.  
- Quote acceptance uniqueness constraint per inquiry.  
- Soft delete policy (no hard deletes).

**Configurable with Restrictions**:

- Acceptance confirmation copy/UX notes (content-managed); legal text controlled centrally.

### Payment & Billing Rules (for Handoff)

- Acceptance prepares booking/payment handoff; no funds are collected in this module.  
- Selected quote’s pre-scheduled appointment slot (date/time) and associated pricing feed the next module for payment intent creation.  
- The Quote entity includes a specific, provider-defined appointment slot. Patient acceptance of the Quote constitutes acceptance of this specific date/time. No further date selection is required or performed in the Booking (FR-006) phase.
- On acceptance, the system MUST ensure the quote exchange rate is locked at the time of acceptance per FR-004 / System PRD pricing rules.  
- Pricing and discounts shown are those defined in FR-004; acceptance does not modify financial terms.
- Post-Acceptance Hold: After acceptance, the system reserves the pre-selected appointment slot for 48 hours to allow the patient to complete the initial payment (deposit or first installment) in FR-006. If payment is not completed within 48 hours, the reservation is released and the slot may be reallocated by the provider.
- Inquiry Cancellation During Hold: If the patient cancels the inquiry (FR-003 Workflow 5) while the 48-hour appointment slot hold is active, the hold is released immediately and the slot is returned to the provider's availability. The accepted quote transitions to "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)". See FR-006 for booking-side guard rules.

---

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- Patient has exactly one active inquiry for which quotes exist.  
- Patients do not have an explicit "decline" action; non-selected quotes are auto-cancelled on acceptance or expire by policy.  

### Technology Assumptions

- Providers have submitted valid, non-expired quotes per FR-004.  
- Booking & Payment module is available for immediate handoff post-acceptance.

### Business Process Assumptions

- Acceptance alone does not disclose patient full identity to provider; reveal occurs after successful payment confirmation.  
- Admin legal copy and acknowledgment text are centrally managed.  

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- Idempotent acceptance: repeat requests do not create multiple accepted states.  
- Concurrency control to prevent race conditions on multiple quotes for same inquiry.  
- Append-only audit trail for acceptance and auto-cancellations.

### Integration Points

- Consumes quote data from FR-004; updates quote/inquiry states; triggers notification service; emits booking handoff payload.

### Scalability Considerations

- Support high-volume acceptance during peak times without delays to notification or state transitions.

### Security Considerations

- Enforce privacy rules: no PII reveal on acceptance; RBAC for all actors; full audit of state transitions; encryption at rest/in transit.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Accept a Quote (Priority: P1)

Patient compares received quotes and accepts one to proceed to booking.

**Independent Test**: Accept one quote; verify competing quotes auto-cancel; verify audit and notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a valid, unexpired quote, when patient accepts, then the quote becomes Accepted and others auto-cancel.  
2. Given an already accepted inquiry, when patient attempts to accept another quote, then system blocks with guidance.  
3. Given acceptance success, when system prepares handoff, then booking entry is available without collecting payment in this step.

### User Story 2 - Handle Expired Quote (Priority: P2)

Patient attempts to accept a quote that has expired.

**Independent Test**: Confirm acceptance is blocked; display expiry; allow selection of other quotes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given an expired quote, when patient views FR-004 quote detail screen or taps Accept, then system shows "Expired" badge and disables Accept button.  
2. Given multiple quotes with one expired, when patient views the inquiry dashboard, then expired quote is visually distinguished and other quotes remain available for acceptance.

### User Story 3 - Inquiry Cancellation During Quote Review (Priority: P2)

Patient cancels the inquiry while quotes are available for review or after accepting a quote.

**Independent Test**: Patient cancels inquiry at various points in the quote review/acceptance lifecycle; verify all quotes cancelled, UI locked, providers notified, and admin oversight updated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given patient has 3 quotes in Quoted stage, When patient cancels inquiry from dashboard, Then all 3 quotes transition to "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)"; Accept/Compare actions disabled; dashboard shows "Cancelled" badge (read-only)
2. Given patient cancels inquiry after accepting a quote with active 48-hour slot hold, When cancellation processes, Then accepted quote becomes "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)"; AcceptanceEvent marked as superseded; slot hold released immediately per Payment & Billing Rules
3. Given provider views their quote outcome after patient cancels inquiry, When opening Screen 4, Then Outcome badge shows "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)" with reason "Inquiry cancelled by patient"
4. Given admin views acceptance oversight after patient cancels inquiry post-acceptance, When filtering, Then superseded acceptance event is visible with "Superseded — Inquiry Cancelled" badge and linked to cancellation audit trail

### Edge Cases

- Network loss during acceptance: system retries safely; no duplicate accept states.  
- Simultaneous accept attempts across devices: first valid acceptance wins; others see informative message.  
- Provider withdraws during confirmation: acceptance blocked with explanation; return to inquiry dashboard.  
- Admin restores mistakenly cancelled quote (with reason): does not override prior acceptance; remains read-only history.
- Patient accepts quote then immediately cancels inquiry (rapid sequence): system processes cancellation; AcceptanceEvent superseded; accepted quote becomes "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)"; slot hold released; booking handoff aborted.
- Patient attempts to accept a quote while inquiry cancellation is being processed (race condition): system checks inquiry status at acceptance confirmation; if cancelled, blocks acceptance with message "This inquiry has been cancelled."
- Patient cancels inquiry while on the acceptance confirmation modal (Screen 3): modal dismissed; inquiry dashboard refreshes to show "Cancelled" badge; all actions disabled.

---

## Key Entities

- **AcceptanceEvent**: inquiryId, acceptedQuoteId, actorId (patient), timestamp, metadata (handoff), supersededByCancellation (boolean, default false)
  - metadata includes pre-scheduled appointment slot (datetime + timezone) and handoff payload identifiers
  - If patient cancels the inquiry after acceptance (FR-003 Workflow 5), the AcceptanceEvent is NOT deleted; instead `supersededByCancellation` is set to true and linked Quote transitions to "Cancelled (Inquiry Cancelled)". The event remains in the audit trail for compliance.
  - Relationships: belongsTo Inquiry; belongsTo Quote  
- **Quote** (from FR-004): id, providerId, status (Accepted/Expired/Cancelled - other accepted/Cancelled - Inquiry Cancelled), expiresAt  
- **AuditEntry**: entityType, entityId, action, actorId, reason, before, after, timestamp
