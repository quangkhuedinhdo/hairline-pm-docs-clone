# FR-014 - Provider Analytics & Reporting

**Module**: PR-05: Financial Management & Reporting | A-08: Analytics & Reporting
**Feature Branch**: `fr014-provider-analytics-reporting`
**Created**: 2025-11-11
**Status**: ✅ Verified & Approved
**Source**: FR-014 from system-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Provider Analytics & Reporting module delivers a **13-screen suite (12 analytical + 1 export config)** split across two tenants: provider and admin.

On the **provider side**, six screens cover the full operational picture — a locked cockpit dashboard for daily triage (Screen 1), four deeper analytical views for conversion performance, patient insights, financial health, and pricing/benchmarks (Screens 2–5), and an export configuration utility (Screen 6). Each screen has a single job and is accessed via the Analytics section of the provider portal.

On the **admin side**, seven screens (Screens 7–13) give Hairline visibility into platform-wide health, provider quality and engagement, patient acquisition, geographic supply/demand gaps, treatment outcomes, financial cashflow, and pricing landscape.

All data shown across every screen is sourced directly from the operational database or derived by calculation. Nothing is aspirational or dependent on external integrations unless explicitly noted.

---

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-XX)**: No direct patient-facing features. Patient behaviour data (inquiry timing, booking patterns, location) feeds the analytics pipeline.
- **Provider Platform (PR-05)**: 6-screen suite (5 screens in the "Analytics" nav + Screen 1 as the platform landing page, not accessed via the Analytics nav section).
- **Admin Platform (A-08)**: 7-screen analytics suite accessible from the admin "Analytics" nav section.
- **Shared Services (S-XX)**: Analytics data pipeline service; report generation service.

### Provider Platform (PR-05) Scope

- Main Dashboard / Cockpit (Screen 1) — daily triage
- Performance & Conversion (Screen 2) — funnel efficiency and TTFQ trends
- Patient Analytics (Screen 3) — patient demographics, satisfaction, and journey
- Finance & Payouts (Screen 4) — revenue breakdown and payout schedule
- Pricing & Benchmarks (Screen 5) — pricing analysis and platform comparison
- Export Report Configuration (Screen 6) — generate PDF/CSV exports

### Admin Platform (A-08) Scope

- Platform Overview Dashboard (Screen 7) — platform health at a glance
- Provider Performance & Engagement (Screen 8) — provider quality and activity monitoring
- Patient Acquisition & Funnel (Screen 9) — how patients enter and move through the platform
- Geographic Intelligence (Screen 10) — demand vs. supply by country
- Treatment Outcomes (Screen 11) — satisfaction-based outcomes
- Financial Health & Cashflow (Screen 12) — platform financial risk and revenue health
- Pricing Intelligence (Screen 13) — pricing landscape across providers and treatments

### Communication Structure

**In Scope**:

- Email notifications for scheduled report delivery (provider-configured)
- In-app alerts when provider metrics fall below defined thresholds (TTFQ SLA breach)

**Out of Scope**:

- Channel attribution (organic, paid ads, social media) — not tracked in database
- Clinical outcome data (graft survival, hair density results) — not tracked in database
- Real-time collaborative dashboard viewing (future enhancement)

### Entry Points

- **Provider**: "Analytics" nav item → defaults to Screen 2 (Performance); Screen 1 (Main Dashboard) is the platform landing page, not the analytics section entry
- **Admin**: "Analytics" nav item → defaults to Screen 7 (Platform Overview)
- **Export**: "Export Report" button available on all provider analytics screens

## Business Workflows

### Main Flow: Provider Reviews Analytics Suite

**Actor**: Provider user with analytics access
**Trigger**: Provider clicks "Analytics" in the nav
**Outcome**: Provider navigates between the 6 provider screens (Screen 1 as landing page + Screens 2–6 via Analytics nav) to understand performance, patients, and financials

1. Provider lands on Performance & Conversion (Screen 2) — checks funnel health for the week
2. Provider navigates to Patient Analytics (Screen 3) — reviews patient location and satisfaction trends
3. Provider navigates to Finance & Payouts (Screen 4) — verifies this month's revenue and upcoming payout
4. Provider navigates to Pricing & Benchmarks (Screen 5) — checks positioning vs. platform median
5. Provider optionally generates a PDF/CSV export via Screen 6

### Main Flow: Admin Monitors Platform Health

**Actor**: Admin
**Trigger**: Admin clicks "Analytics" in admin nav
**Outcome**: Admin reviews platform health, flags issues, and takes action

1. Admin lands on Platform Overview (Screen 7) — checks TTFQ distribution and GMV summary
2. Admin navigates to Provider Performance & Engagement (Screen 8) — reviews underperforming and dormant providers
3. Admin navigates to Patient Acquisition & Funnel (Screen 9) — checks inquiry volume and funnel drop-offs
4. Admin navigates to Geographic Intelligence (Screen 10) — identifies underserved markets
5. Admin navigates to Treatment Outcomes (Screen 11) — reviews cancellation rates and aftercare activation
6. Admin navigates to Financial Health & Cashflow (Screen 12) — reviews payout obligations and cash-at-risk
7. Admin navigates to Pricing Intelligence (Screen 13) — checks for outlier providers on pricing
8. Admin takes action on flagged providers (links through to provider management in FR-015)

### Alternative Flows

**A1 — Drill-down from any chart**: Clicking a chart element (funnel stage, map region, table row, bar) opens the relevant filtered list in the corresponding operational module (Inquiries, Quotes, Bookings, Payments, Schedule).

**A2 — Export from any screen**: Provider clicks "Export" button → reaches Screen 6 pre-populated with the current screen's section selected.

**B1 — Analytics pipeline delay**: Non-blocking banner shown; cached data displayed with last-updated timestamp.

**B2 — Low sample (<30 inquiries for provider)**: Helper copy shown on affected widgets; partial data still rendered.

| Drill-down | Click bar or row → Payout statement detail (CSV/PDF export) |

---

**Business Rules**:

- Income = payments with `payment_status = 'completed'` and `payment_type ≠ 'refund'`

**Data Fields**:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Report type | Radio | Yes | PDF Summary or CSV Detailed |
| Screens to include | Checkboxes | Yes | Performance, Patient Analytics, Finance & Payouts, Pricing & Benchmarks (Screen 1 is excluded — it contains real-time operational data not suitable for static reports) |

| Country filter | Dropdown | No | Optional |
| Treatment filter | Dropdown | No | Optional |
| Email delivery | Checkbox | No | Sends to provider's registered email |
| Schedule recurring | Checkbox | No | Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly |

**Business Rules**:

- Section A tiles always show current snapshot (not historical); B and C sections respect the time range filter

---

#### Screen 8: Provider Performance & Engagement

**Purpose**: Two-section screen — Performance (conversion quality) and Engagement (activity/dormancy). These are distinct jobs: performance tells you how well a provider works; engagement tells you whether they're working at all.

**Filters**: Time range + Country + TTFQ health tier (All / Green / Amber / Red) + Engagement status (All / Active / At Risk / Dormant)

---

##### Section A — Performance

###### Widget 1: Provider League Table

| Column | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Provider | Name + country flag |
| TTFQ p50 | Value + color badge |
| Conversion rate | Inquiries → In progress % |
| Quote acceptance rate | Accepted ÷ Quoted % |
| Avg overall rating | Star rating (from reviews) |
| Quote response rate | Quotes submitted ÷ inquiries distributed |
| vs. Platform | Variance column for conversion rate (+/−%) |
| Status | Health color badge (Green / Amber / Red based on TTFQ + conversion composite) |

- Sortable by any column
- Default sort: TTFQ status (Red first) then conversion rate ascending
- Paginated: 20 per page
- Drill-down: click row → provider's own analytics view (read-only admin view of provider's Screen 2)

###### Widget 2: Performance Distribution

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Scatter plot |
| X axis | TTFQ p50 (minutes) |
| Y axis | Conversion rate (%) |
| Points | One per provider (anonymised label: "Provider A", "Provider B", etc.) — except when admin is on provider detail view |
| Reference lines | Platform median TTFQ · Platform median conversion rate |
| Quadrants | Fast + High conversion (ideal) · Slow + Low conversion (needs support) |
| Drill-down | Click point → that provider's detail |

---

##### Section B — Engagement

###### Widget 3: Provider Activity Table

| Column | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Provider | Name + country |
| Last active | `MAX(action_at)` from `provider_activity_logs` for that `provider_id`; for last login specifically use `MAX(action_at) WHERE action_type = 'login'` |
| Quotes this month | Count of quotes submitted in current calendar month |
| Inquiry response rate | Quotes submitted ÷ inquiries distributed (last 30 days) |
| Status | Active (activity in last 7d) · At Risk (7–30d) · Dormant (>30d no activity) |

- Filter by status (Active / At Risk / Dormant)
- Drill-down: click row → provider detail in FR-015

###### Widget 4: New Provider Ramp

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Line chart (multiple series) |
| X axis | Days since onboarding (0–90 days) |
| Y axis | Cumulative quotes submitted |
| Series | Each provider onboarded in the selected period (one line each, anonymised) |
| Reference line | Platform average ramp curve |
| Purpose | Identify new providers who are struggling to get started |

**Data source**: Providers with `created_at` within the selected period; `quotes.created_at − providers.created_at` for days-since-onboarding offset.

###### Widget 5: Engagement Health Summary

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Three KPI tiles |
| Tile 1 | Active providers count (activity in last 7 days) |
| Tile 2 | At-risk providers count (7–30 days no activity) |
| Tile 3 | Dormant providers count (>30 days no activity) |

---

**Business Rules**:

- Provider identity is NOT anonymised to the admin (admin must be able to identify and contact providers)
- Last-activity data is sourced from `provider_activity_logs.action_at` (canonical activity log); last active = `MAX(action_at)` per provider; last login = `MAX(action_at) WHERE action_type = 'login'` per provider user. Do not use `provider_users.last_login_at` — this field does not exist in the schema.
- "Inquiry response rate" = quotes submitted ÷ inquiries distributed to that provider in the same period; if no distribution tracking exists, use quotes submitted ÷ total platform inquiries in period as a proxy (flag this as lower fidelity)
- Engagement status thresholds (7d / 30d) are configurable by admin

---

#### Screen 9: Patient Acquisition & Funnel

**Purpose**: How patients enter the platform and move through the inquiry-to-booking funnel. Affiliate acquisition tracked where available.

**Filters**: Time range + Country + Treatment type

**Note**: Channel attribution (organic, paid, social) is NOT available — this screen covers volume trends, funnel efficiency, and affiliate-sourced traffic only.

---

##### Widget 1: Inquiry Volume Trend

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Area line chart |
| X axis | Week or month (toggle) |
| Y axis | Inquiry count |
| Comparison overlay | Prior equivalent period (dashed line) |
| Drill-down | Click period → admin Inquiries list for that period |

---

##### Widget 2: Platform Funnel Trend Over Time

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Multi-line chart (one line per stage) |
| X axis | Month |
| Y axis | Conversion % to that stage from Inquiries |
| Lines | Qualified % · Quoted % · Accepted % · In progress % |
| Purpose | Show whether platform-wide conversion is improving or declining |
| Drill-down | Click line point → admin Inquiries list filtered to that stage + month |

---

##### Widget 3: New vs. Returning Patients

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Stacked bar chart (monthly) + KPI tiles |
| Bars | New patient count + Returning patient count per month |
| Tile 1 | New patient rate (period) |
| Tile 2 | Returning patient rate (period) |
| Definition | New = first inquiry ever · Returning = has prior inquiry on record |
| Drill-down | Click bar segment → Patient list filtered by type and period |

---

##### Widget 4: Patient Journey Time (Platform-Wide)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Two KPI tiles + distribution histogram |
| Tile 1 | Platform median days inquiry → payment (p50) |
| Tile 2 | Platform p90 days inquiry → payment |
| Histogram | Distribution across all converting patients (same bins as Screen 3 Widget 3) |

---

##### Widget 5: Inquiry Seasonality

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Calendar heatmap (monthly view, intensity = inquiry count vs. monthly average) |
| Layout | 12 rows (months) × 7 columns (Mon→Sun) |
| Intensity | `inquiry count on day ÷ monthly daily average × 100` |
| Purpose | Identify seasonal peaks and campaign-worthy slow periods |
| Cell tooltip | `Inquiries: N • Daily avg: m • Index: X%` |

---

##### Widget 6: Affiliate Acquisition

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Three KPI tiles + ranked table |
| Tile 1 | Affiliate-sourced bookings (count in period) |
| Tile 2 | Affiliate contribution rate = affiliate bookings ÷ total bookings |
| Tile 3 | Avg affiliate booking value |
| Table columns | Affiliate name · Bookings · Revenue · Commission owed · Conversion rate |
| Drill-down | Click affiliate row → affiliate detail in FR-018 |

**Data source**: `discounts` (affiliate codes) linked to `quotes/payments` via FR-018 `Booking with Affiliate Code` entity. Affiliate-sourced = booking where a valid affiliate discount code was applied at payment.

**Limitation note**: Affiliate tracking begins at the booking stage (when the discount code is applied), not at the inquiry stage. It is not possible to attribute an inquiry to an affiliate source.

---

**Business Rules**:

- Seasonality heatmap always shows a rolling 12-month view regardless of time range filter (for pattern recognition)
- Affiliate rows show only affiliates with at least 1 booking in the selected period; inactive affiliates are filtered out

---

#### Screen 10: Geographic Intelligence

**Purpose**: Strategic supply/demand view. Where is patient demand concentrated? Where does the platform have insufficient provider coverage? Used for expansion planning and targeted provider recruitment.

**Filters**: Time range (affects inquiry and booking data) + Treatment type

---

##### Widget 1: Patient Demand Map

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Choropleth map OR ranked table with flag icons (implementation choice) |
| Value mapped | Inquiry count per patient country (in selected period) |
| Color scale | 5-bin scale from low (cool) to high (warm) |
| Tooltip | `Country · Inquiries: N · Booked: B · Conversion rate: R%` |
| Drill-down | Click country → filtered admin Inquiries list |

---

##### Widget 2: Provider Coverage by Country

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Ranked horizontal bar chart |
| Y axis | Country (provider country) |
| X axis | Active provider count |
| Drill-down | Click bar → Provider list filtered to that country |

---

##### Widget 3: Demand vs. Supply Gap

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Ranked table |
| Columns | Patient country · Inquiry count · Provider count (in that country) · Inquiries per provider · Gap flag |
| Gap flag | Flagged if inquiries per provider > platform median by ≥50% |
| Sort | Default: inquiries per provider descending (highest gap first) |
| Purpose | Identify countries to target for provider recruitment |

**Note**: "Provider country" = provider's registered location. The gap metric is an approximation — patients may travel internationally, so a high inquiries-per-provider ratio in one country does not necessarily mean patients cannot be served.

---

##### Widget 4: Conversion Rate by Patient Country

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Horizontal ranked bar chart |
| Y axis | Patient country (top 15 by inquiry volume) |

| Reference line | Platform median conversion rate |
| Drill-down | Click bar → admin Inquiries list filtered to that country |

---

##### Widget 5: Emerging Patient Origins

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Ranked table |
| Columns | Country · Inquiry count (current period) · Inquiry count (prior period) · Growth % |
| Filter | Countries with >10 inquiries in current period and >20% growth vs prior period |
| Purpose | Spot new markets before they become dominant |

---

**Business Rules**:

- Country data is sourced canonically from `patients.location_id → countries.name`; if `location_id` is null for legacy rows, the UI may temporarily fall back to `patients.location` until migration cleanup is complete. No IP-geolocation fallback is assumed in this version.
- Demand vs. Supply gap table only shows countries with ≥5 inquiries in the selected period to avoid statistical noise
- Map (if used) requires a separate map rendering library; ranked table is the functional fallback

---

#### Screen 11: Treatment Outcomes

**Purpose**: How treatments are performing operationally and in patient satisfaction. **Scope is strictly operational and satisfaction-based** — no clinical outcomes exist in the database (no graft survival rates, no hair density measurements, no complication data).

**Filters**: Time range + Country + Provider (optional) + Treatment type

---

##### Widget 1: Treatment Completion Rate

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Bar chart |
| X axis | Treatment type |

| Drill-down | Click bar → Reviews list filtered to that treatment |

---

##### Widget 5: Aftercare Activation Rate

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | KPI tile + trend line + bar by treatment type |
| KPI | Platform-wide aftercare activation rate = aftercare records created ÷ completed treatments |
| Bar chart | Activation rate broken down by treatment type |
| Drill-down | Click bar → Aftercare records list |

---

##### Widget 6: Provider Distribution by Treatment Specialisation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Stacked horizontal bar chart |
| Y axis | Treatment type |
| X axis | Provider count offering that treatment |
| Drill-down | Click bar → Provider list filtered to that treatment |

**Data source**: `quotes.treatment_id` grouped by `provider_id`; a provider "offers" a treatment if they have submitted at least 1 quote for it in the last 12 months.

---

**Business Rules**:

- Completion rate only calculated for providers with ≥5 confirmed bookings in the period to avoid single-event noise
- No-show is tracked via the quote status label; if no-show status is not explicitly implemented in the data model, this widget is replaced with "cancellation rate only"
- Do NOT add any clinical outcome metrics (graft count, hair density, success rates) — these are not in the database

---

#### Screen 12: Financial Health & Cashflow

**Purpose**: Platform financial risk monitoring and revenue health. The admin's question is: "Is money flowing correctly, what do we owe, and where are the risks?"

**Filters**: Time range + Country + Currency

---

##### Widget 1: Platform GMV & Net Revenue

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Dual-line area chart |
| X axis | Month |
| Y₁ series | Platform GMV (gross payment volume) |
| Y₂ series | Net revenue (GMV minus total provider payout disbursements) |
| Drill-down | Click period → detailed payment records |

**Calculation**: GMV = `SUM(payments.amount)` where `payment_status = 'completed'`; Net revenue = GMV − total disbursed provider payouts in same period.

---

##### Widget 2: Commission Earned Trend

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Bar chart (monthly) |
| X axis | Month |
| Y axis | Commission earned = sum of effective provider commission deductions for completed payments in period, respecting each provider's configured commission model (`percentage` or `flat rate`) |
| Reference line | Target monthly commission (admin-configurable) |
| Drill-down | Click bar → filtered payment records with commission breakdown |

---

##### Widget 3: Refund & Failed Payment Health

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chart type | Four KPI tiles + trend |
| Tile 1 | Refund volume (amount, period) |
| Tile 2 | Refund rate = refund count ÷ total completed payments |
| Tile 3 | Failed payment count (period) |
| Tile 4 | Failed payment rate = failed ÷ total attempted payments |
| Trend | Monthly refund rate + failed rate (dual line) |
| Drill-down | Click tile → filtered Payments list |

---

##### Widget 4: Cash-at-Risk — Platform-Wide Aging

**Business Rules**:

- All quote amounts converted to platform base currency for comparison; raw amounts shown in tooltips
- Outlier threshold (30%) is admin-configurable
- Only quotes with `status ≠ 'inquiry'` (i.e., actually submitted quotes) are included in pricing calculations
- Minimum 5 quotes per treatment per provider required to include that provider in outlier detection

---

## Business Rules

### Global Filter Rules

- **Rule 1**: Default time range on page load = **Last 4 weeks**, all countries
- **Rule 2**: Each screen maintains its own filter state (changing filters on Screen 2 does not affect Screen 3)
- **Rule 3**: Clicking a chart element opens the corresponding pre-filtered operational list in a new context (does not navigate away from the analytics screen)
- **Rule 4**: All screens use skeleton loading states; no full-page blocking spinners
- **Rule 5**: Localize all dates, currencies, and timezones to the user's configured locale (provider locale for provider screens; admin platform locale for admin screens)

### Data Quality Rules

- **Rule 6**: Analytics pipeline updates every 15 minutes; non-blocking banner shown when data is >20 minutes stale
- **Rule 7**: Low sample threshold = **<30 inquiries** for provider screens; helper copy shown but data still rendered
- **Rule 8**: Minimum sample requirements per widget are specified in each screen spec; below minimum, widgets show "Not enough data yet" with the threshold stated
- **Rule 9**: Benchmark pools require minimum 5 providers; if pool is insufficient, benchmark widgets show an explanatory message rather than blank state
- **Rule 10**: All currency amounts converted using daily FX rates cached from the currency conversion API; rates locked at the transaction date for historical data. On API failure, fall back to the previous day's cached rate up to a maximum of **48 hours**; beyond 48 hours, affected widgets show "FX data unavailable" instead of rendering with stale rates

### PII & Privacy Rules

- **Rule 11**: Patient names masked in all provider-facing analytics (ID format only)
- **Rule 12**: Patient identities are never exposed to affiliates (aggregates only)
- **Rule 13**: Provider identities are anonymised in benchmark comparisons and platform-wide charts (providers cannot identify individual competitors)
- **Rule 14**: Admin can see individual provider identities in admin screens for operational support
- **Rule 15**: All analytics access logged with user ID, timestamp, screen accessed, and active filters (12-month retention)

### Access Control Rules

- **Rule 15A**: FR-014 consumes the existing role and permission model; it does not define new roles or expand access beyond the owning platform's permission system.
- **Rule 15B**: If a user lacks permission to view a widget's underlying data domain, the UI MUST not render that widget for that user, and the corresponding widget data MUST not be requested. Remaining widgets reflow within the existing responsive layout.

### Admin Editability Rules

**Editable by Admin**:

- SLA target (minutes) — platform-wide value used across all TTFQ color coding and benchmark charts; per-provider SLA overrides are out of scope for this version
- Benchmark refresh frequency
- Provider engagement status thresholds (Active/At Risk/Dormant day boundaries)
- Outlier detection threshold for Screen 13 (default 30%)
- Target monthly commission reference line on Screen 12 Widget 2

**Fixed in Codebase**:

- Dashboard section order (Screen 1: A → B → C)
- TTFQ formula and funnel stage definitions
- Booking Intensity Index formula
- Commission calculation logic: `IF provider_commissions.type = 'percentage' THEN payment.amount × (effective_rate / 100) ELSE effective_flat_amount` — the conditional is fixed; the rate/amount values are sourced from provider commission configuration

### Performance Rules

- **Rule 16**: All screens load within 3 seconds for 95th percentile (pre-aggregated metrics)
- **Rule 17**: Chart rendering completes within 1 second for ranges ≤12 weeks
- **Rule 18**: Export generation: PDF <60 seconds, CSV <30 seconds
- **Rule 19**: System supports 1,000 concurrent provider analytics sessions without degradation

---

---

## Dependencies

### Internal

- **FR-003**: Inquiry data (`created_at`, `patient_id`, treatment type, spam flag) plus inquiry distribution records (`inquiry_providers.provider_id`, `source`, `status`, `distributed_at`) — feeds all funnel metrics and provider response/distribution analytics
- **FR-004**: Quote data (`status`, `quote_amount`, `commission`, `treatment_id`, `sent_at`, `accepted_at`) — feeds TTFQ, acceptance rate, pricing widgets
- **FR-006**: Booking data (status transitions, `start_date`) — feeds booking intensity heatmap and completion rates
- **FR-007**: Payment data (`amount`, `currency`, `payment_status`, `payment_type`, `created_at`, `is_installment`) — feeds all financial widgets
- **FR-010**: Treatment execution status — feeds completion rate and aftercare activation
- **FR-011**: Aftercare records — feeds aftercare activation rate widgets
- **FR-013**: Reviews (`overall_rating`, `results_rating`, `staff_rating`, `facility_rating`, `value_rating`) — feeds satisfaction widgets
- **FR-015**: Provider master/profile data — provider location and timezone (`providers.country_id`, `providers.city_id`, `providers.timezone`) and effective commission settings (`provider_commissions.type`, `price`, `payment_cycle`) drive localization, commission analytics, and payout cadence
- **FR-017**: Payout records — feeds all payout history and obligation widgets
- **FR-018**: Affiliate records and discount codes — feeds affiliate acquisition widgets
- **FR-026**: Admin settings store — provides admin-configurable analytics values such as SLA target, benchmark refresh frequency, engagement thresholds, and target commission reference line
- **FR-031**: Access control and permissions — governs which admin analytics surfaces and data domains are visible to each authorized role
- **S-03**: Notification Service — handles scheduled export email delivery and secure-link notifications for Screen 6
- **S-05**: Media Storage Service — stores generated export artifacts for 7-day re-download retention and secure-link access
- **Provider Banking Details**: Provider display currency is derived from `banking_details.currency` via provider default-currency resolution; if absent, the current implementation falls back to USD
- **Provider Team / Auth Data**: Engagement views rely on `provider_activity_logs.action_at` as the canonical activity timestamp source (documented in system-data-schema.md). Last active = `MAX(action_at)` per provider. The previously referenced `provider_users.last_login_at` field does not exist in the schema and must not be used.

### External

- **Currency Conversion API**: Daily FX rates for multi-currency display; failure fallback = previous day's cached rates
- **PDF Generation Library**: For export reports (Screen 6)
- **Map Rendering Library** (optional): For Screen 10 choropleth map; ranked table is the functional fallback

### Data Model Additions (Resolved)

The following timestamp columns have been added to the `quotes` table in `system-data-schema.md` to support core analytics metrics:

| Field | Where used | Population |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `quotes.sent_at` | TTFQ calculation (Screens 1, 2, 7, 8) | Set when `status` transitions from `inquiry` → `quote` |
| `quotes.accepted_at` | Quote→Payment Aging (Screens 1, 4, 12) | Set when `status` transitions to `accepted` |

---

## Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Providers access the analytics section at least weekly; daily triage is via Screen 1 (Main Dashboard), not the analytics section
- **Assumption 2**: Admin analytics must remain responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports in accordance with the platform constitution; lower-width layouts may reduce density but must preserve the core workflows
- **Assumption 3**: Provider analytics screens are desktop-first (≥1024px), responsive single-column on ≤1024px
- **Assumption 4**: SLA target is configured as a single platform-wide value (in minutes) by the admin, stored in the admin settings store. Per-provider SLA overrides are out of scope for this version — all providers are measured against the same platform SLA target. Days would be too coarse for this domain (response times range from 30 min to 6+ hours); minutes is the correct unit.
- **Assumption 5**: Payout cadence (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly) is currently sourced from provider commission configuration (`provider_commissions.payment_cycle`), not from the provider profile record itself
- **Assumption 6**: Patient-country analytics resolve from `patients.location_id` referencing `countries.id`; during transition, legacy rows may still fall back to `patients.location` for display/grouping compatibility until data cleanup is complete
- **Assumption 7**: Channel attribution (organic vs. paid vs. social) is not in scope for any screen — only affiliate-sourced traffic is trackable from the current data model
- **Assumption 8**: Provider-side analytics widgets (TTFQ benchmarks, pricing scatter, patient journey, conversion breakdowns, etc.) are **PRD-derived, not transcription-derived**. Client transcriptions focus primarily on admin-side reporting; the provider analytics UX was product-designed to complement the admin view. This is an accepted design decision — future verification passes MUST NOT flag these widgets as discrepancies from client transcriptions.
- **Assumption 9**: FX rate fallback (previous day's cached rate) is capped at a maximum staleness of **48 hours**. Beyond 48 hours, affected financial widgets display a "FX data unavailable" state rather than rendering with stale rates.
- **Assumption 10**: Country widgets (Screens 3, 10) flag rows resolved via legacy `patients.location` fallback with a subtle UI indicator (tooltip or badge) until the `patients.location_id` backfill is complete, so users can distinguish canonical vs. transitional data.
