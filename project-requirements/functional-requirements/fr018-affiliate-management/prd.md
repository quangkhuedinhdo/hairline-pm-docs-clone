## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-03)**: Patients apply affiliate discount codes at checkout to receive promotional offers
- **Provider Platform (PR-05)**: No direct provider interaction; providers see bookings with affiliate codes applied
- **Admin Platform (A-07)**: Full affiliate lifecycle management including onboarding, code creation, commission tracking, and payout processing
- **Shared Services (S-02)**: Payment processing service handles affiliate commission payouts; notification service sends payout confirmations

### Multi-Tenant Breakdown

**Patient Platform (P-03)**:

- Patients can enter affiliate discount codes during booking checkout
- System validates affiliate codes and applies discounts automatically
- Booking confirmation shows affiliate discount applied (code name displayed)
- Patients do NOT see affiliate commission structure or payout information

**Provider Platform (PR-05)**:

- Providers see bookings with affiliate codes in their dashboard (read-only view)
- Providers understand that affiliate discounts come from Hairline's commission (not their payout)
- No provider action required for affiliate-referred bookings

**Admin Platform (A-07)**:

- **Affiliate Onboarding**: Create affiliate accounts with contact details, payment information, commission structure
- **Discount Code Management**: Generate unique affiliate discount codes with customizable parameters (percentage/fixed amount, expiration, usage limits)
- **Performance Tracking**: View real-time statistics on referral counts, booking conversions, revenue generated per affiliate
- **Commission Calculation**: System automatically calculates affiliate commissions based on completed bookings
- **Payout Processing**: Monthly batch payout workflow with approval and confirmation
- **Reporting**: Generate affiliate performance reports for analysis and optimization

**Shared Services (S-02)**:

- **Payment Processing Service**: Handles affiliate commission payouts via configured payment method (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.)
- **Notification Service**: Sends payout confirmation emails to affiliates with transaction details
- **Audit Trail Service**: Logs all affiliate-related transactions (code usage, commission calculations, payouts)

### Communication Structure

**In Scope**:

- Email notifications to affiliates when discount codes are created or updated
- Email notifications to affiliates when monthly payouts are processed
- Admin-to-affiliate communication via notes in admin dashboard (internal only)
- System-generated payout confirmations with transaction breakdown

**Out of Scope**:

- Direct messaging between patients and affiliates (handled outside platform)
- Marketing material creation (affiliates use externally hosted materials)
- Affiliate training or onboarding calls (manual process outside platform)

### Entry Points

- **Admin-initiated**: Admins access Affiliate Management section in admin dashboard to onboard new affiliates
- **Affiliate-initiated**: Affiliates log into dedicated affiliate portal to view performance dashboard
- **Patient-triggered**: Patients enter affiliate codes during booking checkout, triggering tracking and commission calculation
- **System-scheduled**: Automated monthly job generates payout reports on 7th of each month (configurable)

4. Admin submits affiliate onboarding form
5. System creates affiliate account with:
   - Generated unique affiliate ID

   - Discount amount: Percentage (e.g., 10%) OR fixed amount (e.g., £50)
   - Expiration date (optional)
   - Maximum usage count (optional, e.g., first 200 users)
   - Auto-apply vs. code-based (manual entry required)

9. System sends email to affiliate with:
   - Dashboard login credentials
   - Discount code(s) created for their promotion

### Alternative Flows

  2. Admin clicks "Add New Discount Code"
  3. System displays discount code creation form
  4. Admin configures new code with different parameters (different discount percentage, expiration, etc.)
  5. System validates and saves new code linked to same affiliate account
  6. System sends email notification to affiliate about new code availability
- **Outcome**: Single affiliate can promote multiple discount codes, all tracked under same affiliate account for commission calculation

     - Total revenue generated for Hairline (from affiliate referrals)
     - Total commissions earned (all-time and pending payout)
     - Upcoming payout amount and date

     - Code usage count (applied vs. completed checkouts)
     - Conversion rate (applied codes that resulted in bookings)
     - Revenue per code
     - Commission earned per code
  5. Affiliate reviews data and downloads PDF report if needed
- **Outcome**: Affiliate has full visibility into performance metrics and earnings without admin intervention

**B1: Invalid Discount Code Application**

- **Trigger**: Patient enters affiliate discount code that is expired, reached usage limit, or invalid
- **Steps**:
  1. Patient enters discount code at checkout
  2. System validates code against:
     - Expiration date (if set)
     - Usage limit (if set)
     - Active status
  3. System determines code is invalid/expired
  4. System displays error message: "This discount code is no longer valid. Please check the code or contact support."
  5. Patient can proceed with checkout without discount OR enter different valid code
  6. System does NOT track this as affiliate referral (no commission triggered)
- **Outcome**: Patient notified of invalid code; affiliate not credited for failed code application; checkout can still complete

**B2: Payout Processing Failure**

- **Trigger**: Monthly automated payout job encounters payment processing error (invalid bank account, insufficient funds in Hairline account, etc.)
- **Steps**:

  1. System initiates monthly payout batch on 7th of month
  2. System calculates commissions owed to each affiliate based on completed bookings from previous month
  3. System attempts to process payment via payment gateway
  4. Payment gateway returns error (e.g., "Invalid bank account number")
  5. System logs error with affiliate ID, amount, and error message
  6. System marks payout as "Failed" in admin dashboard
  7. System sends alert notification to admin team with failed payout details
  8. Admin reviews error and contacts affiliate to resolve payment details
  9. Admin manually triggers retry once payment details corrected
  10. System re-processes payment and marks as "Paid" upon success
- **Outcome**: Failed payouts flagged for admin review; manual intervention resolves payment issues; affiliate receives delayed payout with explanation

**B3: Affiliate Account Suspension**

- **Trigger**: Admin detects fraudulent activity or policy violation by affiliate (e.g., fake referrals, unauthorized promotion)
- **Steps**:
  1. Admin navigates to affiliate profile
  2. Admin clicks "Suspend Account"
  3. System prompts admin for suspension reason (required field)

  6. System disables all discount codes associated with affiliate (codes no longer valid at checkout)
  7. System sends email notification to affiliate about suspension with reason
  8. System retains historical data (referrals, commissions, payouts) but prevents new activity
  9. Pending unpaid commissions are held pending investigation
  10. Admin can reinstate account later by changing status to "Active"
- **Outcome**: Affiliate account suspended; discount codes deactivated; pending payouts held; full audit trail maintained

  - **Integration point**: Payout processing workflow calls Payment Service API to initiate transfers with affiliate payment details

- **FR-017 / Module A-05: Admin Billing & Financial Management**
  - **Why needed**: Affiliate discount code application must integrate with commission calculation and booking payment processing
  - **Integration point**: When patient applies affiliate code, system calculates discount from Hairline's commission and tracks for affiliate payout

- **FR-019 / Module A-06: Discount & Promotion Management**
  - **Why needed**: Affiliate discount codes are a subset of platform-wide discount system
  - **Integration point**: Affiliate codes follow same discount validation logic (expiration, usage limits, single-code-per-booking rule)

- **FR-003 / Module P-03: Booking & Payment Processing**
  - **Why needed**: Affiliate code application occurs during patient booking checkout flow
  - **Integration point**: Patient platform sends discount code to booking service for validation and application

- **FR-001 / Module P-01: Patient Authentication & Profile Management**
  - **Why needed**: Track which patients used affiliate codes (without exposing patient identity to affiliate)
  - **Integration point**: Booking records link patient ID to affiliate code for internal tracking (anonymized in affiliate dashboard)

### External Dependencies (APIs, Services)

- **External Service 1: Stripe Payment API (or equivalent payment gateway)**
  - **Purpose**: Process affiliate commission payouts via bank transfer or PayPal
  - **Integration**: RESTful API calls to initiate transfers with affiliate bank account/PayPal details
  - **Failure handling**: If payout fails, system marks as "Failed" status and alerts admin for manual retry after resolving payment details

- **External Service 2: Email Service Provider (e.g., SendGrid)**
  - **Purpose**: Send payout confirmation emails and discount code notifications to affiliates
  - **Integration**: SMTP or API-based email sending with templated messages
  - **Failure handling**: If email fails, system logs error and admin can manually resend via dashboard

- **External Service 3: PDF Generation Library (e.g., wkhtmltopdf, Puppeteer)**
  - **Purpose**: Generate downloadable performance reports and payout receipts for affiliates
  - **Integration**: Server-side PDF generation from HTML templates
  - **Failure handling**: If PDF generation fails, system displays HTML version and allows manual retry

### Data Dependencies

- **Entity 1: Active Affiliate Accounts**
  - **Why needed**: Cannot create discount codes or process payouts without onboarded affiliate accounts
  - **Source**: Admin creates affiliate accounts via Affiliate Management module

- **Entity 2: Completed Bookings with Payment Confirmation**
  - **Why needed**: Affiliate commissions calculated only for completed bookings where patient has paid in full
  - **Source**: Booking & Payment Processing module (FR-003) provides booking completion events

- **Entity 3: Discount Code Catalog**
  - **Why needed**: System must validate affiliate codes at checkout against active discount code database
  - **Source**: Admin creates discount codes linked to affiliate accounts

---

## Assumptions

### User Behavior Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Affiliates will check their dashboard at least once per week to monitor performance
- **Assumption 2**: Patients will correctly enter affiliate discount codes (uppercase/lowercase variations handled by system)
- **Assumption 3**: Affiliates prefer monthly payouts over weekly/bi-weekly schedules (fewer transactions, easier accounting)
- **Assumption 4**: Affiliates will primarily use code-based discounts (manual entry) rather than auto-apply links

### Technology Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Affiliates access dashboard via modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox - last 2 versions)
- **Assumption 2**: Payment gateway supports batch payout processing for multiple affiliates simultaneously
- **Assumption 3**: Email service provider has 99.9%+ deliverability rate for transactional emails
- **Assumption 4**: Server infrastructure can handle up to 1000 discount code validation requests per minute during peak periods

### Business Process Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: Hairline will manually vet and approve affiliate partners before onboarding (no self-service affiliate signup)
- **Assumption 2**: Affiliate commission structure will remain stable (5-25% of Hairline commission or £50-£200 fixed per booking)
- **Assumption 3**: Finance team will reconcile affiliate payouts within 48 hours of processing to detect errors
- **Assumption 4**: Affiliate program will not exceed 10% of Hairline's total commission revenue within first 12 months (cost control)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Affiliate module requires event-driven architecture to trigger commission calculations when bookings complete
- **Technology**: Discount code validation should use in-memory caching (Redis) to minimize database queries during checkout
- **Performance**: Commission calculation jobs should run asynchronously to avoid blocking booking confirmation workflow
- **Storage**: Audit trail requires append-only data storage for all affiliate transactions (no deletions, only inserts)

### Integration Points

- **Integration 1: Patient Booking Checkout → Affiliate Code Validation**
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with discount code, patient ID (anonymized), booking total
  - **Authentication**: Internal service-to-service API with JWT tokens
  - **Error handling**: If validation service unavailable, allow checkout to proceed without discount (prevent checkout failure)

- **Integration 2: Booking Completion Event → Commission Calculation**
  - **Data format**: Event payload with booking ID, affiliate code used, final payment amount, Hairline commission amount
  - **Authentication**: Internal event bus with message authentication
  - **Error handling**: If commission calculation fails, retry 3 times with exponential backoff; alert admin if all retries fail

- **Integration 3: Payout Processing → Payment Gateway API**
  - **Data format**: JSON payload with affiliate payment details (bank account/PayPal), payout amount, transaction metadata
  - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication with payment gateway
  - **Error handling**: If payment fails, mark as "Failed" status and alert admin; support manual retry after 24 hours

### Scalability Considerations

- **Current scale**: Expected 20-30 active affiliates at launch, 500-1000 code applications per month
- **Growth projection**: Plan for 100+ affiliates within 12 months, 10,000+ code applications per month
- **Peak load**: Handle 100 simultaneous discount code validations during promotional campaigns
- **Data volume**: Expect 50,000+ affiliate transaction records per year (code applications, commission calculations, payouts)
- **Scaling strategy**: Horizontal scaling of API services; database partitioning by affiliate ID for transaction history

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Affiliates access dashboard via username/password; support MFA (optional) for high-value affiliates
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC): Affiliates view only their own data; Admins view all affiliate data
- **Encryption**: All payment details (bank accounts, PayPal emails) encrypted at rest using AES-256; TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Audit trail**: Log all access to affiliate payment details with timestamp, user ID, and IP address
- **Threat mitigation**: Rate limiting on dashboard API (100 requests/minute/user) to prevent abuse; CAPTCHA on affiliate login after 3 failed attempts
- **Compliance**: PCI-DSS compliance for handling affiliate bank account details; GDPR compliance for affiliate personal data (right to deletion)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Affiliate Onboarding and First Code Creation (Priority: P1)

Admin onboards new affiliate partner, creates discount code, and affiliate accesses dashboard to view initial setup.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality required for affiliate program to launch; without this, no affiliates can join or promote platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating affiliate account, generating discount code, and verifying affiliate receives login credentials and can access dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin is logged into admin dashboard, **When** admin navigates to Affiliate Management and clicks "Add New Affiliate", **Then** system displays affiliate onboarding form with all required fields
2. **Given** admin fills affiliate details (name, email, payment method, commission structure), **When** admin submits form, **Then** system creates affiliate account and sends login credentials to affiliate email within 2 minutes
3. **Given** affiliate account is created, **When** admin creates discount code linked to affiliate, **Then** system validates code uniqueness and saves code with "Active" status
4. **Given** discount code is created, **When** affiliate logs into dashboard using credentials, **Then** system displays affiliate dashboard with discount code details and "0 referrals" initial state

---

### User Story 2 - Patient Applies Affiliate Code at Checkout (Priority: P1)

Patient discovers affiliate discount code, applies it during booking checkout, and receives discounted price.

**Why this priority**: Core user journey that drives affiliate referrals and patient conversions; essential for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating test affiliate code, simulating patient checkout, and verifying discount is applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** patient is at booking checkout with £1000 total, **When** patient enters valid affiliate code "PARTNER10" (10% discount), **Then** system validates code and applies £100 discount (total becomes £900)
2. **Given** patient applies affiliate code, **When** patient completes payment, **Then** system records booking with affiliate code and triggers commission calculation for affiliate
3. **Given** patient attempts to apply expired affiliate code, **When** system validates code, **Then** system displays error message "This discount code is no longer valid" and checkout proceeds without discount
4. **Given** patient applies affiliate code that reached usage limit, **When** system validates code, **Then** system displays error message and prevents code application

---

### User Story 3 - Affiliate Views Real-Time Performance Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Affiliate logs into dashboard to check referral count, commission earnings, and upcoming payout details.

**Why this priority**: Critical for affiliate engagement and transparency; affiliates need visibility into earnings to stay motivated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating affiliate account with simulated referrals and verifying dashboard displays accurate statistics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** affiliate has 10 completed referrals generating £5000 total revenue, **When** affiliate logs into dashboard, **Then** system displays accurate statistics: 10 referrals, £5000 revenue, £750 commission earned (15% of Hairline commission)
2. **Given** affiliate has pending payout of £750, **When** affiliate views dashboard, **Then** system displays "Next payout: £750 on December 7, 2025"
3. **Given** affiliate has multiple discount codes, **When** affiliate clicks on individual code, **Then** system displays per-code breakdown: usage count, conversion rate, revenue, commission earned
4. **Given** affiliate wants performance report, **When** affiliate clicks "Download Report", **Then** system generates PDF report with all-time statistics and payout history

---

### User Story 4 - Admin Processes Monthly Affiliate Payouts (Priority: P1)

Admin reviews automatically generated payout list on 7th of month and processes batch payouts to all affiliates.

**Why this priority**: Core admin workflow required to fulfill affiliate commission obligations; without this, affiliates won't be paid.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering monthly payout job and verifying payouts are calculated correctly and processed successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** it is December 7th, 2025, **When** automated payout job runs, **Then** system generates payout list for all affiliates with completed bookings in November 2025
2. **Given** payout list displays 5 affiliates owed total £3500, **When** admin clicks "Process Batch Payout", **Then** system initiates payment gateway API calls to transfer funds to each affiliate's bank account/PayPal
3. **Given** payout processing completes successfully, **When** payment gateway confirms transactions, **Then** system marks all payouts as "Paid" and sends confirmation emails to affiliates with transaction details
4. **Given** one payout fails due to invalid bank account, **When** payment gateway returns error, **Then** system marks that payout as "Failed" and alerts admin with error message for manual resolution

---

### User Story 5 - Affiliate Commission Calculation for Completed Booking (Priority: P1)

System automatically calculates affiliate commission when patient completes booking using affiliate code.

**Why this priority**: Core business logic that ensures affiliates are credited correctly; must be accurate to maintain trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating booking completion with affiliate code and verifying commission calculation matches expected formula.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** patient books £1000 treatment using affiliate code "PARTNER10" (10% discount), **When** patient completes payment of £900, **Then** system calculates Hairline commission (15% of £1000 = £150) and affiliate commission (15% of £150 = £22.50)
2. **Given** affiliate has fixed commission structure of £50 per booking, **When** patient completes booking using affiliate code, **Then** system credits affiliate account with £50 commission regardless of booking value
3. **Given** booking is completed with affiliate code, **When** commission calculation completes, **Then** system updates affiliate dashboard with new referral count and commission earned in real-time
4. **Given** patient refunds booking after completion, **When** refund is processed, **Then** system reverses affiliate commission and deducts £22.50 from affiliate's pending payout

---

### User Story 6 - Admin Edits Affiliate Commission Structure Mid-Program (Priority: P2)

Business negotiates new commission terms with affiliate; admin updates commission structure with effective date.

**Why this priority**: Important for business flexibility and affiliate relationship management; not required for MVP but needed for scaling.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing affiliate commission structure and verifying new rates apply only to future bookings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** affiliate currently has 15% commission rate, **When** admin edits commission structure to 20% with effective date December 1, 2025, **Then** system saves new rate and applies to bookings completed on/after December 1st
2. **Given** affiliate has pending payout for November 2025 bookings, **When** admin changes commission rate in December, **Then** November payout is calculated using old 15% rate (no retroactive changes)
3. **Given** commission structure is updated, **When** system sends notification to affiliate, **Then** email includes old rate, new rate, and effective date for transparency
4. **Given** admin sets effective date in past, **When** system validates edit, **Then** system displays error: "Effective date cannot be in the past" and prevents save

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **affiliate has £45 pending payout (below £50 minimum threshold)**? System does NOT process payout; commission rolls over to next month until threshold is reached.
- How does system handle **duplicate discount codes across different affiliates**? System validates uniqueness across ALL affiliates; if code exists, displays error "Code already exists for affiliate [name]".
- What occurs if **patient applies affiliate code but cancels booking before payment**? System tracks code as "applied" but NOT "completed"; no commission credited to affiliate.
- How to manage **affiliate account suspension while pending payout exists**? Pending commission is held pending investigation; if suspension is lifted, payout processes normally; if permanent ban, pending commission is forfeited.
- What happens when **payment gateway API is down during payout processing**? System retries 3 times with exponential backoff; if all retries fail, marks payouts as "Failed" and alerts admin to retry manually next day.
- How does system handle **booking refund after affiliate payout has been processed**? System tracks negative balance for affiliate; deducts refunded commission from next payout (if next payout insufficient, carries negative balance forward).
