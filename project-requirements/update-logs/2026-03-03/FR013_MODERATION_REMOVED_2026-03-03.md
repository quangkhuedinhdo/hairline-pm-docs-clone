## Summary

Removed the pre-publication moderation gate from FR-013 (Reviews & Ratings). Client transcriptions were reviewed and confirmed that no moderation workflow was requested. Reviews now publish immediately upon patient submission. Admin retains the ability to edit or remove published reviews post-publication for policy violations.

## Transcription Evidence

- **AdminPlatform-Part1 (lines 91–100)**: Client discusses admin ability to **add/seed** reviews for new providers (authenticated reviews from external sources), not moderate patient-submitted reviews before publication.
- **AdminPlatform-Part1 (lines 103–110)**: Client states data should never be permanently deleted — "archived somewhere" — with 7-year legal retention. This supports the retention policy but says nothing about moderation.
- **HairlineApp-Part1 (lines 232–248)**: Client describes the review submission flow as straightforward — patients leave reviews and they appear on clinic/provider profiles. No mention of a moderation gate.
- **No transcription** across all 7 files mentions "moderation", "approve before publish", "review queue", or any pre-publication review gate.

## Conclusion

The moderation workflow (Submit → Pending Moderation → Admin Approves → Published) was an AI-generated addition not based on client requirements.

## Minor Follow-Up Updates

- **2026-05-14**: Restructured FR-013 `Screen Specifications` into explicit tenant subsections (`Patient Platform`, `Admin Platform`, `Provider Platform`) and corrected heading hierarchy so each screen is now nested under its tenant as `#### Screen N`.
- **2026-05-14**: Aligned FR-013 review data structure to the current patient app form by adding read-only context fields (`clinic_name`, `treatment_name`), canonical rating keys (`overall/facility/staff/results/value`), explicit patient payload contract (`feedback_text`, `photos[]`), and cross-tenant schema consistency requirements for Provider/Admin review surfaces.
