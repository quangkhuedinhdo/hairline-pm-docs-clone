# FR-014 Provider Analytics & Reporting — 12-Screen Expansion

**Date**: 2026-04-16
**Type**: Major Update
**Document Updated**: `local-docs/project-requirements/functional-requirements/fr014-provider-analytics-reporting/prd.md`
**PRD Version**: 2.0 → 3.0

---

## Summary

The FR-014 PRD has been expanded from a single-screen provider cockpit to a full 13-screen analytics suite covering both the Provider and Admin tenants. The expansion was driven by the need to avoid cramping multiple analytical jobs into single screens and to ensure each screen has a clear, single purpose. All widget data was verified against `system-data-schema.md` before being included.

**Screen 1 (Provider Main Dashboard) remains LOCKED** — the v2.0 design lock is preserved; this change adds new screens only.

## What Changed

### Screen Count

| Before (v2.0) | After (v3.0) |

- Per-provider TTFQ ranking table (sortable, filterable by country/treatment)
- Per-provider quote acceptance rate ranking table
- Provider response time distribution (stacked bar — all providers bucketed)
- Provider conversion rate ranking (Pareto-style bar chart)
- Widgets source: `providers`, `quotes`, `inquiries`, `payments`, provider activity log

#### Screen 8 — Patient Acquisition & Funnel
- Patient acquisition channels (Donut — booking-level source: direct/search/referral/affiliate)
- Affiliate performance table (affiliate code → inquiry count → booking count → revenue)

- Top routing paths (patient country → provider country, by booking volume)
- Widgets source: `patients`, `providers`, `inquiries`, `payments` (country fields)

#### Screen 10 — Treatment Outcomes (Satisfaction Proxy)

- Rating breakdown by dimension (overall / results / staff / facility / value — Radar chart)
- Rating trend over time (line chart — monthly average overall rating)
- Review volume trend (monthly)
- Low-rated treatment alerts (treatments with avg results_rating < 3.0 — flagged list)
- **Note**: No clinical outcome data exists in DB. All "outcome" metrics are satisfaction-based from the `reviews` table. True clinical outcomes deferred to future scope.
- Widgets source: `reviews`, `treatments`, `payments`

#### Screen 11 — Financial Health & Cashflow

### Screen 13 — Export Report Configuration (Unchanged)

Screen 13 (Export Config) is carried forward from v2.0 without modification.

## Data Constraints & Notes

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| `quotes` has no `created_by`/`staff_id` | No team-level or coordinator-level TTFQ breakdown |
| `inquiries` has no `source` field | Lead source (Screen 3, Screen 8) is booking-level only via `bookings_with_affiliate_code` |
| `quotes.sent_at` / `quotes.accepted_at` tracked via quote timeline activity | Confirm with dev team that these timestamps are reliably extractable for TTFQ and aging calculations |
| `payments.commission_amount` not stored | Commission is always calculated: `payment.amount × (quotes.commission / 100)` |
| `reviews` contains satisfaction ratings only | No clinical outcome data — Screen 10 is satisfaction proxy only |
| Platform benchmarks: minimum 5 providers in pool | Benchmarks suppressed if pool < 5 providers for a given treatment |

---

## What Was NOT Changed

- Screen 1 (Provider Main Dashboard) design — **LOCKED** at v2.0
- Module scope and multi-tenant architecture
- Security and privacy rules
- Dependencies on FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-007, FR-010, FR-015, FR-018
- Data retention (24 months)
- Analytics pipeline frequency (15 minutes)
- Admin requirements baseline

## Post-Expansion Structural Correction (2026-04-17)

**Type**: Minor Update

Screen ordering and tenant grouping corrected after expansion:

- **Screen 6 (Export Report Configuration)** moved from tail position (was Screen 13) to immediately follow the Provider analytics screens (Screens 1–5), since it is a Provider-tenant feature
- **Admin screens renumbered**: old Screens 6–12 → new Screens 7–13
- **Tenant section headers added** to Screen Specifications following fr009 convention: `### Provider Platform (PR-05)` groups Screens 1–6; `### Admin Platform (A-08)` groups Screens 7–13; individual screen headings demoted from `###` to `####`
- All screen-number cross-references updated throughout (Module Scope, Business Workflows, Entry Points, Business Rules, Success Criteria, Dependencies, Data Model Gaps, Functional Requirements Summary, Change Log)
