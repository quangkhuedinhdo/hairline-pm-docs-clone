## Organization by Date

### 2026-06-23/ (3 files)

#### **FR-018 PRD Verified & Approved**

- `FR018_PRD_VERIFIED_APPROVED_2026-06-23.md` - Marked the FR-018 Affiliate Management PRD as `✅ Verified & Approved` after the final `verify-fr FR-018` pass and selected documentation cleanups; added PRD changelog v2.4 and updated the approvals table to the template-aligned verified approval state for Product Owner, Technical Lead, and Stakeholder.

#### **FR-018 Attribution and Dependency Alignment**

- `FR018_ATTRIBUTION_AND_DEPENDENCY_ALIGNMENT_2026-06-23.md` - Applied Product Owner follow-up decisions after `verify-fr FR-018`: separated affiliate referral attribution from final price-discount priority so a provider-side promotion can win the patient-facing discount while a valid captured affiliate code/link still earns affiliate commission after payment-confirmed booking completion; updated FR-018 Rule 11, REQ-018-003, REQ-018-010, Integration 2, edge cases, and Booking with Affiliate Attribution; aligned FR-017's affiliate-vs-provider discount edge case; clarified FR-019 auto-applied conflict metadata preservation; corrected FR-019's affiliate-bound bulk-generation AC to one unique code per selected affiliate; and updated FR-022's stale payout mapping from FR-018 Screen 5 to Screen 7.

#### **FR-018 Verification Fixes (v1.7 → v1.8 → v1.9 → v2.0)**

- `FR018_VERIFICATION_FIXES_2026-06-23.md` - Applied three `verify-fr` passes. **Pass 1 (v1.8)**: set the **audit trail to 10-year retention** per constitution (financial records stay 7-year min); redefined the percentage **commission base as % of booking revenue** (not % of Hairline commission) per Product Owner decision — added Rule 14, corrected the Screen 2 preview and User Story 3/5 worked examples ($150), and aligned the `system-prd.md` FR-018 requirement line; **tightened commission bounds** to 5-25% / fixed min $50 (warning at 20%); **defined Performance Tier bands and Campaign Eligibility criteria** (new Affiliate Segmentation Rules subsection); standardized **bank-account masking** wording to "last 4 digits"; and **fixed the payout schedule at monthly-on-the-7th** per the client transcription. **Pass 2 (v1.9)**: reconciled the **initial affiliate Status = "Pending"** on create across Screen 2 / Screen 10 / Screen 10.1 (was contradictorily "Active"); added a **per-booking Hairline-funded cost ceiling** (Rule 15, Screen 4 Margin Guard + AC-6, REQ-018-041 — discount + commission may not exceed Hairline's commission on a booking; resolves the v1.8 Finance follow-up); and added a **Currency Rule note** that client GBP figures are illustrative vs USD base literals. **Pass 3 (v2.0)**: moved affiliate payout execution out of FR-018 so FR-017 / A-05 owns approval, retry, and Stripe transfers; corrected Screen 3 links to Screen 6 and Screen 8; and added read-only affiliate access to externally hosted marketing materials (REQ-018-042).

### 2026-06-22/ (4 files)

#### **FR-018 Lifecycle Integrity Verification & Revision**

- `FR018_LIFECYCLE_INTEGRITY_VERIFICATION_2026-06-22.md` - Verified FR-018 against full affiliate-lifecycle coherence and resolved 8 issues in v1.6 → v1.7: added affiliate **offboarding/deactivation** (workflow B5, Screen 3.3, Rule 12, REQ-018-039) defining the terminal Inactive state with final settlement (pay/forfeit/write-off incl. negative balances); standardized currency on **USD** with all FX sourced from FR-029 (Currency Rule rewrite, REQ-018-040, FR-029 dependency, `£`→`$`); documented **code-based attribution** as accepted policy (Rule 11); recognized the Affiliate Portal as a **scoped external surface of the Admin tenant** (Module Scope note + constitution Principle I amendment); set usage caps to decrement on **completed** redemptions only with a soft applied-event rate limit (Rule 13, REQ-018-004); added **Pending** initial status; and made affiliate **name admin-controlled** (removed from self-service). Also amended `.specify/memory/constitution.md` Principle I with explicit user approval.

#### **FR-018 Screen Architecture Restructure & Affiliate Activation Flow**

- `FR018_SCREEN_ARCHITECTURE_RESTRUCTURE_2026-06-22.md` - Restructured FR-018 Screen Specifications (v1.2 → v1.3) from 6 screens into 9 admin screens + 3 modals + a tabbed affiliate portal: added Affiliate Detail (Screen 3), Code Generation Results (Screen 5), system-wide Promo Code Management (Screen 6), shared Promo Code Detail (Screen 7) and shared Payout/Transaction Detail (Screen 9), consolidated Payout Management with folded Billing History (Screen 8), and Modals A-C (Suspend/Reinstate, Edit Commission, Confirm Batch Payout). Added an affiliate account activation flow mirroring FR-015 (one-time set-password link + resend), Add/Edit fields (phone, language, tax/VAT ID, performance tier, activation status, last login), self-service affiliate profile, and REQ-018-027 through REQ-018-036 with related rules, entities, and testing. Same-day addendum (v1.3 → v1.4): standardized affiliate payouts on Stripe (removed PayPal/Other) and replaced the payment-method fields with a provider-mirrored bank-detail set (account holder name, bank name, account number, routing/SWIFT, optional IBAN) per FR-032, executed as Stripe transfers via FR-017 / S-02; added REQ-018-037. Further addendum (v1.4 → v1.5): adopted FR-033-style decimal sub-screen notation — modals became Screens 3.1/3.2/7.1, Code Generation Results became Screen 4.1 (confirmed a full screen), the remaining admin screens were sequentially renumbered (5-8), and the affiliate portal was split into a shell (Screen 9) with one screen per tab (9.1-9.4). Further addendum (v1.5 → v1.6): expanded the affiliate tab screens (9.2 Promo Codes, 9.3 Payouts, 9.4 Profile) with full field lists, added the affiliate onboarding/activation screen group (Screen 10 + 10.1 Set Password, 10.2 Resend Activation, 10.3 Welcome / Get Started) mirroring FR-015, added REQ-018-038, and normalized all PRD table dividers to the `| --- |` form.

#### **FR-018 Affiliate Code Generation Alignment**

- `FR018_AFFILIATE_CODE_GENERATION_ALIGNMENT_2026-06-22.md` - Updated FR-018 to own affiliate-specific promo code generation, filtered bulk generation, one-affiliate-per-code attribution, affiliate dashboard code visibility, and payout attribution; added FR-019 ownership notes so affiliate-bound code generation points back to FR-018 while FR-019 remains the shared validation/redemption engine; synced FR-022 A-07 filters for affiliate cohort selection before bulk code generation.

#### **Sprint 1 A-09a Questionnaire Re-triage**

- `SPRINT_1_A09A_QUESTIONNAIRE_RETRIAGE_2026-06-22.md` - Re-triaged the Sprint 1 A-09a questionnaire backlog against current PRD/source/Postman evidence: create/list/detail/version/audit are now live, old questionnaire rows were re-framed without prematurely marking them resolved, and the current blocker is narrowed to Screen 2 access (`View/Edit -> Questionnaire set not found`) plus the missing post-create transition into question authoring.

### 2026-06-18/ (1 file)

#### **Sprint Readiness Bug ID & Scout Status**

- `SPRINT_READINESS_BUG_ID_AND_SCOUT_STATUS_2026-06-18.md` - Updated the sprint readiness workflow with a stable `Bug ID` column for confirmed bugs and a new `Scout flagged` status for code/PRD/API scouting leads that should be prioritized for manual testing but are not yet confirmed defects. The Sprint 1-5 readiness reports and templates now include `Bug ID`; IDs are assigned only from `Recorded only` onward and remain blank for `Review pending` / `Scout flagged`. `create-bug-tasks` now preserves the source row as `Source Bug ID` in generated bug task artifacts.

### 2026-06-16/ (1 file)

#### **Bug Task FE/BE Split & Side-Labeled Task Status**

- `BUG_TASK_FE_BE_SPLIT_2026-06-16.md` - Updated the `create-bug-tasks` and `sprint-readiness-reporting` skills so a bug spanning both sides is no longer created as one combined task. `create-bug-tasks` now classifies each bug FE-only / BE-only / Both and splits Both into separate `[BUG][FE]` and `[BUG][BE]` tasks (each with a single side label and a new `Scope Boundary` description section: *This task covers*, *Counterpart task*, *Contract/handoff*); the `Bugs, FE Task, BE Task` label combination was removed. The readiness backlog `Task Status` column now stores side-labeled Plane key(s) — `Task created (FE: HAIRL-123)`, `Task created (BE: HAIRL-123)`, or `Task created (FE: HAIRL-123; BE: HAIRL-124)` for a split bug — kept in one cell with one row per source bug.

### 2026-06-14/ (1 file)

#### **Sprint 2–5 Readiness Scaffolds**

- `SPRINT_2_TO_5_READINESS_SCAFFOLDS_2026-06-14.md` - Created sprint readiness & fix-backlog scaffolds for all remaining sprints from the launch plan: Sprint 2 (`2026-06-05`), Sprint 3 (`2026-06-12`), Sprint 4 (`2026-06-19`), and Sprint 5 — Launch (`2026-06-22`). Folder dates anchor on the May 29 Sprint 1 milestone and step one week forward (matching the launch-plan Sprint 2–4 Review dates), with Sprint 5 using its real June 22 launch date. Each scaffold mirrors the Sprint 1 report structure with launch-plan-anchored scope, modules, stories, and deferrals, plus `Review pending` evidence-gap rows; the Sprint 5 scaffold is adapted for a launch event using go-live activities and the eight critical smoke-test flows instead of modules.

### 2026-06-12/ (3 files)

#### **Create Bug Tasks Skill**

- `CREATE_BUG_TASKS_SKILL_2026-06-12.md` - Created the project-local `create-bug-tasks` skill for converting confirmed bug reports and `Recorded only` sprint readiness backlog rows into Plane-ready `[BUG]` task artifacts. The skill includes self-contained references for task format, source-row mapping, label/priority/cycle/parent rules, PRD/document/design reference placement, Plane dry-run/live creation, and optional backlog status updates.

#### **Sprint 1 A-09a Questionnaire Create Bug**

- `SPRINT_1_A09A_QUESTIONNAIRE_CREATE_BUG_2026-06-12.md` - Updated the Sprint 1 readiness backlog with a confirmed A-09a defect showing that `Create New Questionnaire Set` currently does not persist a new draft set. The report now captures direct admin UI evidence, mock-driven frontend catalog behavior, and live API route-not-found verification against the expected FR-025 questionnaire-set endpoints.

#### **Sprint 1 PR-06 Provider Treatment Pricing Review**

- `SPRINT_1_PR06_PROVIDER_TREATMENT_PRICING_REVIEW_2026-06-12.md` - Updated the Sprint 1 readiness backlog with confirmed PR-06 provider-treatment findings. The report now records hidden detail navigation on treatment cards, wrong provider detail routing, provider-pricing structure/status mismatches against FR-024, stale list pricing after successful save, hardcoded currency handling, and an unwired deactivate action.

### 2026-06-11/ (1 file)

#### **Sprint Readiness Resolution Status**

- `SPRINT_READINESS_RESOLUTION_STATUS_2026-06-11.md` - Updated the `sprint-readiness-reporting` skill contract and bundled backlog template to add resolution lifecycle statuses after Plane task creation. Readiness rows can now distinguish `Resolved - pending re-test` from `Resolved - verified YYYY-MM-DD`, with re-test evidence required before a blocker is treated as verified and no longer blocking sprint readiness.

### 2026-06-09/ (1 file)

#### **Sprint Readiness Reporting Skill**

- `SPRINT_READINESS_REPORTING_SKILL_2026-06-09.md` - Created `local-docs/project-automation/skills-engineering/sprint-readiness-reporting/`, a new skill for Hairline sprint readiness-report operations. The skill standardizes context resolution for the active readiness-report file and launch-plan file, scaffold creation from a bundled backlog template, basic vs advanced update routing, evidence/status writing rules, and blocked-follow-up re-test handling after earlier blockers are fixed.

### 2026-06-08/ (1 file)

#### **Sprint 1 Provider Onboarding Review**

- `SPRINT_1_PROVIDER_ONBOARDING_REVIEW_2026-06-08.md` - Updated the Sprint 1 readiness backlog with first provider-focused Admin A-02 review findings. Provider creation through the Admin wizard is now recorded as partially verified for `Hairline Test Clinic 1010`, while activation/password setup and Owner login remain open. Added confirmed follow-up rows for notification deep-link failure, country-code dropdown UX/phone formatting, broken document preview, and shared PR-06 phone-input impact.

### 2026-06-04/ (1 file)

#### **FR-021 Provider/Admin Design Layout Verification**

- `FR021_ADMIN_DESIGN_LAYOUT_VERIFICATION_2026-06-04.md` - Created FR-021 Provider/Admin Web Screens 2-10 design-layout verification report against current `layout-temp/` JPGs, expanded in place from the original Screens 3-10 report. All 9 requested screens have layout coverage; overall verdict is `🔴 FAIL` because Screen 9 appears to allow publishing without a required change summary and Screen 8 also has a critical publish-summary control issue. Follow-up review moved Screen 4 and Screen 6 to `🟢 GOOD`; Screen 7 remains `🟡 PARTIAL` for active-language coverage gaps.

### 2026-05-29/ (3 files)

#### **Sprint 1 Readiness Fix Backlog**

- `SPRINT_1_READINESS_FIX_BACKLOG_2026-05-29.md` - Created `local-docs/product-plans/2026-05-29/sprint-1-readiness-fix-backlog.md`, a Sprint 1 readiness and fix-backlog report based on the current launch plan. The report anchors Sprint 1 scope to Core: Inquiry, Quote & Treatment, captures modules, stories, deferrals, Sprint-level readiness blockers, and module-level evidence gaps, and explicitly distinguishes readiness gaps from confirmed product defects because no staging/product review was performed in this pass.

#### **Sprint Readiness Fix Backlog Template**

- `SPRINT_READINESS_FIX_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE_2026-05-29.md` - Created `local-docs/product-plans/template/sprint-readiness-fix-backlog-template.md`, a reusable template for sprint-start product review against the launch plan. The template anchors sprint scope to the launch plan, captures sprint-level blockers and module-level remaining fixes with reproduction steps, actual/expected outcomes, and evidence links, explicitly keeps Plane ticket creation outside this document, and was revised the same day to remove the Sprint Readiness Summary section and merge Document Control with Sprint Summary.

#### **Client Sprint Review Report Template**

- `CLIENT_SPRINT_REVIEW_REPORT_TEMPLATE_2026-05-29.md` - Created `local-docs/product-plans/template/client-sprint-review-report-template.md`, a concise business-facing post-sprint report template. The template uses an executive summary, Mermaid launch progress track plus readiness gauge, compact sprint outcomes table, and combined open-items / risks / next-sprint direction section for client review.

### 2026-05-27/ (1 file)

#### **FR-013 Provider/Admin Design Layout Verification**

- `FR013_PROVIDER_ADMIN_DESIGN_LAYOUT_VERIFICATION_2026-05-27.md` — Created FR-013 Screens 5-10 design-layout verification report against current `layout-temp/` JPGs. All six requested Provider/Admin screens have layout coverage; Screens 6, 8, and 9 are `🔴 FAIL` due to critical composer validation, consent-attestation, reviewer-display-name, and takedown-decision/removal-reason gaps; Screens 5 and 7 are `🟡 PARTIAL`; Screen 10 is `🟢 COMPLETE`.

### 2026-05-25/ (1 file)

#### **FR-021 Machine Translation and Language Catalog Alignment + Verification Fixes**

- `FR021_MACHINE_TRANSLATION_AND_LANGUAGE_CATALOG_ALIGNMENT_2026-05-25.md` — FR-021 v1.2 follow-up: added Admin machine-translation provider/API-key management, notable provider options, missing-key prefill and full non-English language replacement draft-generation modes, machine-translation alternative flow, review-needed/audit/credential-security requirements, FR-029 currency ownership alignment, and FR-032 language-catalog cleanup so provider spoken-language capacity consumes FR-021 language options surfaced through settings rather than treating FR-026 as owner. **v1.3 verification fixes (same file)**: defined "elevated authorization" as Super Admin role (FR-031); assigned locale-aware number formatting ownership to S-02 in Currency Rule 2; added timezone fallback rule to Screen 1; added Rule 13 for max cache stale window (≤5 min); added Preparation locale exclusion rule to Screen 4; updated system PRD FR-021 module list to include P-01, PR-06, S-03; added reciprocal FR-021 dependency entry in FR-029. **v1.4 verification fixes (same file)**: added FR-031 as formal internal dependency; removed "preview only" from Screen 8 Import mode; corrected SC-002 to "< 2 seconds"; added HTTP 403 error-handling requirement to Admin Platform localization management integration point.

### 2026-05-21/ (1 file)

#### **FR-019 Design Layout Verification**

- `FR019_DESIGN_LAYOUT_VERIFICATION_2026-05-21.md` — Full FR-019 design-layout verification against current `layout-temp/` JPGs. Same-day revisions narrowed the final report to Screens 1-10 only, corrected provider mappings, then rechecked Admin Screen 6 and Provider Screen 10 after new full-table files were added. Overall verdict remains `🔴 BLOCKED`: admin Screens 3/4 and provider Screen 9 still fail the FR contract; Screen 6 improves to `🟡 PARTIAL`, and Screen 10 improves to `🟢 COMPLETE`.

### 2026-05-20/ (2 files)

#### **Launch Plan Patch — Timeline Shift, Aftercare Reorganisation & User Stories**

- `LAUNCH_PLAN_PATCH_2026-05-20.md` — Five coordinated patch groups: (1) entire timeline shifted +7 days due to operational delay; (2) aftercare modules P-05 / PR-04 / A-03 moved from Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 to group them with the template and config setup (A-09b, A-09c) they depend on; (3) user stories added to all four sprint sections; (4) implementation-readiness correction pass after PRD cross-check — soft-launch/store fallback clarified, FR-036 excluded as future placeholder, Sprint 1/2 notification timing corrected, A-01/FR-026/FR-007/FR-008/FR-019 mappings fixed, FR-021/023/031/035 DoDs expanded, patient i18n/privacy/DSR moved before RC freeze, and integrated launch user stories added; (5) Sprint Zero added as a May 11–15 soft-launch preparation window, with Sprint 1 planning moved to May 18 and Sprint 1 development moved to May 19.

#### **Launch Plan Review & Coverage Rework**

- `LAUNCH_PLAN_REVIEW_2026-05-20.md` — Three-track review of the Launch Plan plus follow-up correction pass: (1) PRD/FR cross-check via Haiku subagents across all 36 FRs — every sprint's DoD reorganised into Sprint-level gates + per-module sections with explicit FR citations; new coverage added including FR-007b retry/grace, P-05 standalone aftercare path, A-09c Stripe pre-save test + currency-pair sequencing + FX sync, A-10 keyword flagging + "Hairline Admin" intervention, PR-05/A-07/A-04 full stories+DoD authored, FR-013 reviews integrated into Sprint 3, FR-021 i18n + FR-023 compliance added to Sprint 4, FR-022 search/filtering allocated as cross-cutting P1 MVP; (2) timeline logical-consistency fixes, later extended with RC store-submission/code-freeze, store-review fallback, Sprint 2 creative deliverable alignment, and UAT triage; (3) follow-up coverage fixes for FR-002/003/006/007/007b/008/011/012/013/014/017/018/019/021/022/023/032-036 and expanded launch smoke tests. Modules sections of all four sprints use `Tenant | Modules | FR(s)` 3-column tables.

### 2026-05-19/ (1 file)

#### **FR-021 Localization Management Revision**

- `FR021_LOCALIZATION_MANAGEMENT_REVISION_2026-05-19.md` — Major revision of FR-021: added canonical translation registry, tenant-specific language selectors, Admin localization screens for supported locales / registry / key detail / import / export / publish history / coverage, draft-to-publish versioning, rollback, English source-locale protection, JSON validation, fallback behavior, and expanded requirements/entities.

### 2026-05-15/ (1 file)

#### **Agent Guidelines Slimdown**

- `AGENT_GUIDELINES_SLIMDOWN_2026-05-15.md` — Slimmed `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` from 284/277 lines to 101 lines each. Deleted redundant sections (Skill Definitions and Locations table, Deployment Instructions, six General Skills tables, generic Skill Enforcement Rules) and consolidated six scattered file/folder governance sections into a single `## File & Folder Rules` permission table. The two genuinely project-specific enforcement rules (BLOCKING status for the 4 project skills, "read `SKILL.md` end-to-end before running") were folded into the existing "When to Invoke (STRICT)" block. File Structure section retained but trimmed to just the `local-docs/` directory tree.

### 2026-05-14/ (4 files)

#### **Launch Plan Patch**

- `LAUNCH_PLAN_PATCH_2026-05-14.md` — Seven coordinated patches to the May 14 – June 16 Launch Plan: (1) moved P-01 / PR-01 / A-02 auth+onboarding into Sprint 1 so the patient + provider journey is self-contained; (2) moved P-03b payment sub-features (installment, multi-currency, receipts, refunds) from Sprint 4 → Sprint 2; (3) App Store Gantt cleanup — final build submission moved June 10–11 → June 9 (giving Apple 4 business days), beta build reconciled to single day June 4, account setup trimmed 9d → 5d; (4) Sprint Planning relocated from Sundays to Fridays of the previous sprint, all weekend work eliminated; (5) load redistribution — added Cumulative Regression (S1+S2) to Sprint 3 last 2 days, Sprint 4 keeps only Final Integration Regression (S3+S4+cross-tenant); (6) soft-launch reframing of June 15–16 as vendor-facing not consumer-public, with minimal safeguards (DB backup, deployment artifact tag, explicit Go/No-Go decision point), formal hypercare dropped; (7) cleanup of misleading `:done` markers, explicit submodule listings, owner assigned to "App Store approvals received" milestone.

#### **FR-013 Verification Fixes — Rounds 4–5 (Multi-document)**

- `FR013_VERIFICATION_FIXES_ROUND_4_2026-05-14.md` — FR-013 v1.15 + FR-020 v1.9 + FR-030 v1.4 + FR-022 sync. Resolves round-4 verification (2 Critical + 4 Medium + 2 Minor) plus round-5 selected fixes and status closeout: (1) split retention windows — 7y review content vs 10y `AdminAction` audit log per Constitution §VI; (2) structured `source_metadata` schema for admin-seeded reviews; (3) 3-month review eligibility confirmed as product-owner additional requirement; (4) REQ-013-018a added — per-treatment aggregated sub-scores endpoint as FR-014 data contract; (5) patient-edit safeguards — re-run B2 flagging, set `last_edited_at`/`edit_count`, audit, notify provider, surface "Edited {relative_time}" marker; (6) canonical reviewer alias algorithm (`First L.` with numeric dedup) + admin-seeded `reviewer_display_name` rule; (7) FR-022 master reference synced for FR-013 Screens 5 & 7; (8) Screen 6 provider-response wording re-cast as "immutable while published; one replacement after admin removal"; (9) FR-030/FR-020 review notification catalogs aligned with `review.published`, `review.response_posted`, `review.removed_by_admin`, and `review.takedown_decided`; (10) takedown requests now require a patient reason instead of optional message; (11) FR-013 marked `✅ Verified & Approved` with template-aligned Change Log and Approvals sections.

#### **FR-013 Verification Fixes (Rounds 1–3, Multi-document)**

- `FR013_VERIFICATION_FIXES_2026-05-14.md` — Round 1 (8 issues) + Round 2 (5 issues) + Round 3 (5 issues) verification resolution across FR-013, FR-032, FR-020, FR-022, system-prd.md. Round 1: provider response scope conflict, missing review notification events, stale screen ref, narrowed B2 flagging trigger, feedback min-length rationale, A4 metrics recalc, SC-005 reclassified, patient review edit added to system PRD. Round 2: added FR-014 as FR-013 dependency, recalc on patient-edit republish, broadened audit rule to cover patient self-edits & provider responses, length-bounds rationale (Screens 1 & 6), uniqueness rule (one review per completed procedure) added to system PRD. Round 3: FR-030 takes ownership of review-invite cadence (Screen 10 becomes link-out), provider may submit one replacement response after admin removal, REQ-013-021 renumbered to -009 for sequential ordering, photo guidelines "versioned" clarified as audit-logged only, takedown message enforces 10-char minimum when provided

#### **FR-013 Review Flow Scope Expansion**

- `FR013_REVIEW_FLOW_SCOPE_EXPANSION_2026-05-14.md` - FR-013 v1.4-v1.10 scope and verification alignment: added completed-treatment prerequisite, expanded review-management screens across Patient/Provider/Admin, moved admin insert/edit reviews into current phase, replaced patient direct deletion with admin-decided takedown request workflow, aligned system PRD to immediate publication with post-publication admin flagging/removal, expanded module/dependency traceability for PR-06/S-03/S-05/FR-020/FR-022/FR-030/FR-032, and removed `Submitted` from the review status vocabulary

### 2026-05-13/ (2 files)

#### **Launch Plan**

- `LAUNCH_PLAN_2026-05-13.md` - Created the Hairline Platform Launch Plan for May 14 – June 16, 2026: four development sprints + launch sprint, full module allocation across all three tenants, Mermaid Gantt charts, day-by-day sprint schedules, ceremony cadence, website and App Store timelines, non-dev milestones, and risk register

#### **Mobile Bug Report Pass**

- `MOBILE_BUG_REPORT_PASS_2026-05-13.md` - Created the May 13 mobile bug report skeleton (`HL78`), replaced the starter instruction row with the first real bug entry, and clarified that the missing AI head scan background-removal and annotation steps are a mobile-only integration gap rather than a launch-plan update

### 2026-05-12/ (1 file)

#### **FR-019 Screen Specifications Restructure + FR-004 Alignment**

- `FR019_SCREEN_SPECIFICATIONS_RESTRUCTURE_2026-05-12.md` - Major restructure of FR-019 Screen Specifications (v1.3 → v1.5): unified three-program model (Admin-via-Provider, Provider Self-Created, Hairline-Funded & Direct-Issued), expanded screen inventory from 3 to 11 type-aware screens, preserved Applied vs Completed redemption state distinction, expanded Key Entities (PromotionProgram, PromotionCode, Adoption, Application). v1.5 follow-up: aligned with FR-004 by introducing `scope` (REUSABLE / AD_HOC_QUOTE_BOUND) and `bound_quote_id` on PromotionProgram, split Screen 9 into two entry modes (Standalone vs Inline-from-Quote). FR-004 v1.8: Promotion fields retyped across Screens 1/3/5/7, free-text `promotionNote` field removed (every discount must be a structured PromotionProgram).

### 2026-05-07/ (3 files)

#### **Notification Dispatch Report**

- `NOTIFICATION_DISPATCH_REPORT_2026-05-07.md` - Created a patient notification dispatch audit report for `rosario12@example.com / password`, listing all 76 persisted inbox notifications with payload summaries and deep-link fields

#### **Admin Module Re-Verification**

- `ADMIN_MODULE_REVERIFICATION_2026-05-07.md` - Live codebase re-verification of A-03, A-05b, A-05c, A-09a, A-09c, A-10; corrects completion % estimates: A-09c drops from 56% → 10% (all settings pages are mock/setTimeout), A-05b drops from 33% → 20% (approve/retry backend routes missing), A-10 rises from 5% → 22% (substantial UI logic built, zero API wiring)

#### **Progress Report Completion**

- `PROGRESS_REPORT_COMPLETION_2026-05-07.md` - Filled all placeholder sections in the 2026-05-06 progress update report: report period, project phase, executive summary (health, snapshot table, progress since Jan 27, blockers, client decisions), mobile app / provider dashboard / admin dashboard summaries, and comprehensive findings & next phase (remaining issues, prioritized upcoming tasks, V2 vision)

### 2026-05-06/ (3 files)

#### **Design Verification & Templates**

- `FR022_VERIFICATION_FIXES_2026-04-13.md` - FR-022 fourth verification pass (v2.4): specialist filter removed from provider scope; B2 overflow workflow removed (pagination is sole model); REQ-022-009 moved to P2; 4 stale system PRD screen code cross-references updated; Active Status + Available Capacity filters added to FR-003/Screen 7a; Implementation Notes debounce corrected. **Fifth pass (v2.5)**: commission type corrected from "Tier-based" to "Flat Rate" (FR-015 sync gap); User Story 2 Scenario 3 status corrected to "Draft"; FR-001 auth dependency replaced with FR-031; PostgreSQL references removed (MySQL 8.0+ only); provider platform max search query length defined (200 chars)
- `FR008_PROVIDER_DESIGN_LAYOUT_VERIFICATION_2026-04-13.md` - FR-008 provider full-scope layout verification; Main Flow 1 is `🟡 PARTIAL`, Main Flow 2 is `🔴 BLOCKED` due to missing Path B detail-state coverage, missing `View Travel Details`, and misbound hotel review fields
- `FR022_FR019_ALIGNMENT_2026-04-13.md` - Applied selected FR-022 follow-up resolutions: moved FR-012 messaging search surfaces to P2 and reassigned provider messaging to PR-07, removed non-authoritative search-result export behavior outside deferred REQ-022-009, finalized FR-019 Screen 4 (Discount Code Catalog), and aligned the system PRD FR-022 summary

#### **Hairline Mobile April 2026 Postman Collection Test**

- `HAIRLINE_MOBILE_APRIL_2026_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_TEST_2026-04-15.md` - Live sweep of the Hairline Mobile April 2026 API collection routes; 44 original endpoints were tested in the initial sweep, 29 of those are now confirmed meaningful, 7 return successful but sparse payloads pending product confirmation, 8 remain unresolved failures, and 25 follow-up validations were run separately to clear ambiguity. Follow-up checks confirmed the ISO-3 city lookup, meaningful `inquiry_id` payloads, brute-force quote-bearing inquiry coverage, successful provider profile and treatment update retries, an endpoint-correction retry guide for resolved endpoints including the quote decimal-precision rule, and a separate sparse-payload review for endpoints that may legitimately return empty arrays.
- **2026-04-20**: `POSTMAN_STATE_DEPENDENT_RETEST_2026-04-20.md` - Completed the state-dependent portion of the Apr 2026 collection report with Postman MCP retests. The confirmed-state travel updates still hard-lock after submission, duplicate review prevention still fires on the known completed quote, aftercare confirmation still stops at the Stripe client step, purchase history is still empty for the main test account, and the documented instructions route now returns HTML 404 during recheck.

### 2026-04-16/ (2 files)

#### **FR-014 Provider Dashboard Design Lock**

- `FR014_DASHBOARD_DESIGN_LOCK_2026-04-16.md` - FR-014 PRD major rewrite (v1.0 → v2.0) to match the finalized Provider Main Dashboard design (Figma node 6358-111596). Design is locked — do not reopen layout or widget-type decisions. Key changes: single-page cockpit (3 sections: A Inbox, B Performance, C Financials); global filters now Time range (default Last 4 weeks) + Country; cross-filtering specified; Section A (Inbox) fully specified with TTFQ tiles and inquiry queue; Section B widgets updated to funnel chart (correct stages), bullet chart (TTFQ vs SLA), calendar heatmap (Booking Intensity Index), and donut chart (Patient Location); Section C updated to area line (Earnings Trend), Pareto bar (Revenue by Treatment), stacked horizontal bar (Quote→Payment Aging, new), and column bar + inline table (Payouts); low-sample threshold changed from <5 to <30 inquiries.

#### **FR-014 12-Screen Analytics Suite Expansion**

- `FR014_12_SCREEN_EXPANSION_2026-04-16.md` - FR-014 PRD full expansion (v2.0 → v3.0): from 3 screens to 13-screen analytics suite (5 Provider + 7 Admin + 1 Export Config). Screen 1 remains locked. New provider screens: Performance & Conversion Deep-Dive (Screen 2), Patient Analytics (Screen 3), Finance & Payouts Deep-Dive (Screen 4), Pricing & Benchmarks (Screen 5). New admin screens: Platform Overview (Screen 6), Provider Performance & Engagement (Screen 7), Patient Acquisition & Funnel (Screen 8), Geographic Intelligence (Screen 9), Treatment Outcomes/Satisfaction (Screen 10), Financial Health & Cashflow (Screen 11), Pricing Intelligence (Screen 12). 104 functional requirements total (REQ-014-001 through REQ-014-104). All widgets verified against system-data-schema.md; data constraints documented (no team-level TTFQ, booking-level affiliate tracking only, satisfaction-only outcome proxy).

### 2026-04-17/ (3 files)

#### **FR-014 Verification Fixes**

- `FR014_VERIFICATION_FIXES_2026-04-17.md` - FR-014 PRD v3.0 → v3.1 post-verification fixes. Screen 7 admin drill-downs corrected (Tiles 4/5 → Screen 8; B4 → Screen 11; Section C financial tiles C1–C4 → Screen 12). Screen count narrative corrected to "13-screen suite (12 analytical + 1 export config)". `quotes.sent_at` and `quotes.accepted_at` timestamp columns added to system-data-schema.md (populated on status transitions; feed TTFQ and Quote→Payment aging analytics). System PRD FR-014 expanded with a dedicated Admin Requirements subsection (12 new bullets) covering platform overview, provider performance & engagement, patient acquisition, geographic intelligence, treatment outcomes, financial health, pricing intelligence, anonymisation, admin-configurable parameters, and audit logging. Screen 2 per-widget "minimum 10 inquiries" exception removed — unified under global Rule 7 (<30). Drill-down references standardised to number-only form. Approvals table placeholders replaced with "Pending review".
- `FR014_CODE_ALIGNED_FIXES_2026-04-17.md` - FR-014 PRD v3.1 → v3.2 code-alignment pass after source-code verification. Percentage-only commission analytics updated to support both Percentage and Flat Rate provider commission models. Dependency references corrected to the implemented sources (`providers.timezone`, `provider_commissions.type/price/payment_cycle`, `banking_details.currency`, `inquiry_providers`). Admin analytics restored to responsive-web scope. Provider-specific SLA storage documented as an unresolved canonical-data dependency.
- `FR014_VERIFICATION_FIXES_V2_2026-04-17.md` - FR-014 PRD v3.2 → v3.3 second verification round. Commission formula updated to conditional (percentage vs. flat-rate). Last-activity source resolved to `provider_activity_logs.action_at` after backend migration audit (confirmed `provider_users.last_login_at` does not exist; `provider_activity_logs` added to system-data-schema.md). SLA scoped to platform-wide configurable target in minutes (per-provider overrides deferred). Screen 7 B2 self-referential drill-down fixed to Screen 8. Module Scope corrected to 6-screen provider suite. Admin workflow extended to include Screens 11 and 13. Screen 6 export exclusion for Screen 1 documented. REQ numbering resequenced: Screen 6 moved to REQ-014-060–063; Screens 7–13 shifted to REQ-014-064–104 (continuous 001–104).

### 2026-04-18/ (2 files)

#### **FR-014 Backend Alignment**

- `FR014_BACKEND_ALIGNMENT_2026-04-18.md` - FR-014 follow-up alignment after the verification report. Backend cross-check confirmed patient-country provenance should normalize on `patients.location_id -> countries.id/name`, with legacy `patients.location` retained only as a temporary fallback for unmigrated rows. Removed the unsupported IP-geolocation fallback from FR-014, aligned the system PRD FR-014 SLA parameter to a single platform-wide target, and added Screen 6 export-service dependencies (`S-03` Notification Service, `S-05` Media Storage Service).

#### **FR-014 Verification Fixes v3.5**

- `FR014_VERIFICATION_FIXES_V35_2026-04-18.md` - FR-014 PRD v3.4 → v3.5 verification fixes. Screen 6 PDF branding narrowed to `providers.profile_image` only (colors-from-profile removed — no schema field). Rule 10 updated to cap FX fallback at 48 hours, beyond which affected widgets show "FX data unavailable". Added Assumption 8 recording that provider-side analytics widgets are PRD-derived by design (not a transcription discrepancy — future verification passes must not re-flag). Added Assumption 9 (FX freshness cap) and Assumption 10 (legacy `patients.location` fallback UI indicator).

### 2026-04-20/ (2 files)

#### **FR-017 Full-Scope Design Layout Verification**

#### **Postman State-Dependent Retest**

- `POSTMAN_STATE_DEPENDENT_RETEST_2026-04-20.md` - Completed the `State-Dependent Failures` section in the Apr 2026 mobile API test report using live Postman MCP retests. Confirmed travel-update lock responses, duplicate-review protection, Stripe client-confirmation dependency, empty purchase history, no active aftercare state, and a new route discrepancy on `get-aftercare-instructions-medications`.

FR-001 Screen 16 validation rule and dependency updated. Report file updated. Mirrors Inquiry Cancellation Reasons pattern.

#### **FR-026 Verification Fixes (v1.3 → v1.4)**

- `FR026_VERIFICATION_FIXES_2026-03-28.md` - Applied 8 verification fixes: removed duplicate MFA bullet (deferred to FR-031); added flag_url to Entity 4 and REQ-026-011; added IP/device-level rate limiting as fixed-in-codebase; corrected stale FR-003 Screen 11 → Screen 8a (6 occurrences); fixed propagation test scenarios from 30 seconds to 1 minute; moved FR-024/FR-011 to Downstream Consumers section; standardised "Friend Referral" seeding data; corrected FR-003 module name to P-02: Quote Request & Management.

- **2026-05-07**: `NOTIFICATION_DISPATCH_REPORT_2026-05-07.md` - Created a patient notification dispatch audit report for `rosario12@example.com / password`, listing all 76 persisted inbox notifications with payload summaries and deep-link fields.
- **2026-05-13**: `LAUNCH_PLAN_2026-05-13.md` - Initial Hairline Platform Launch Plan for May 14 – June 16, 2026 (four dev sprints + launch sprint, full module allocation, Mermaid Gantts, ceremonies, milestones, risk register).
- **2026-05-14**: `LAUNCH_PLAN_PATCH_2026-05-14.md` - Seven coordinated patches to the launch plan: pulled P-01/PR-01/A-02 into Sprint 1, moved P-03b payment sub-features to Sprint 2, App Store schedule cleanup with final build moved to June 9, Sprint Planning relocated to Fridays (no weekend work), regression load split between Sprint 3 and Sprint 4, soft-launch reframing with minimal safeguards (DB backup, deployment artifact tag, Go/No-Go decision point), and `:done` marker cleanup.
- **2026-05-20**: `LAUNCH_PLAN_PATCH_2026-05-20.md` - Three patches: (1) full +7-day timeline shift (Sprint 1 now May 21–29, launch June 22–23) due to operational delay; (2) aftercare modules P-05/PR-04/A-03 moved from Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 to group with A-09b/A-09c configuration they depend on; (3) user stories added to all four sprint sections (36 stories total, grouped by role: Patient / Provider / Admin / Platform Foundations).
- **2026-05-20**: `LAUNCH_PLAN_REVIEW_2026-05-20.md` - Three-track review plus follow-up correction pass: PRD/FR cross-check, sprint DoD/story rework, module table restructure, timeline fixes now including RC store-submission/code-freeze and store-review fallback, FR/module corrections for travel, support, promotions, payment, payout, search, compliance, affiliate, and FR-036 topline placeholder, plus expanded launch smoke tests.
- **2026-05-29**: `SPRINT_1_READINESS_FIX_BACKLOG_2026-05-29.md` - Created Sprint 1 readiness and fix-backlog report from `launch-plan.md`, with Sprint 1 scope, modules, stories, deferrals, readiness blockers, and module-level evidence gaps for later staging/product review.
- **2026-06-08**: `SPRINT_1_PROVIDER_ONBOARDING_REVIEW_2026-06-08.md` - Updated Sprint 1 provider onboarding backlog rows after Admin wizard screenshot review: provider creation is partial-pass, activation/Owner login remains open, and A-02/PR-06 follow-up bugs are logged for notification deep-linking, phone country-code UX, phone formatting, and document preview.
- **2026-06-09**: `SPRINT_READINESS_REPORTING_SKILL_2026-06-09.md` - Created the `sprint-readiness-reporting` skill for Hairline readiness-report context resolution, scaffold creation, basic vs advanced update routing, evidence/status rules, and blocked-follow-up re-test handling.
- **2026-06-11**: `SPRINT_READINESS_RESOLUTION_STATUS_2026-06-11.md` - Added resolution lifecycle statuses to the sprint-readiness reporting workflow so fix rows can distinguish implementation-reported fixes from reviewer-verified re-test closure.
- **2026-06-12**: `CREATE_BUG_TASKS_SKILL_2026-06-12.md` - Created the `create-bug-tasks` skill for turning confirmed bug reports and `Recorded only` readiness backlog rows into Plane-ready `[BUG]` tasks with module/FR traceability, explicit labels, early PRD/document/design references, and optional post-create backlog status updates.
- **2026-06-14**: `SPRINT_2_TO_5_READINESS_SCAFFOLDS_2026-06-14.md` - Created Sprint 2–5 readiness & fix-backlog scaffolds from `launch-plan.md`, dated `2026-06-05` / `2026-06-12` / `2026-06-19` / `2026-06-22` (one-week-spaced from the May 29 Sprint 1 milestone; Sprint 5 on its real launch date), each with launch-plan-anchored scope, modules, stories, deferrals, and `Review pending` evidence gaps.
- **2026-06-16**: `BUG_TASK_FE_BE_SPLIT_2026-06-16.md` - Updated `create-bug-tasks` to split FE+BE bugs into separate `[BUG][FE]`/`[BUG][BE]` tasks (single side label each, new `Scope Boundary` description section, `Bugs, FE Task, BE Task` combination removed), and updated `sprint-readiness-reporting` so the `Task Status` column stores side-labeled Plane key(s) — `Task created (FE: HAIRL-123; BE: HAIRL-124)` for a split bug — in one cell per source row.
- **2026-06-18**: `SPRINT_READINESS_BUG_ID_AND_SCOUT_STATUS_2026-06-18.md` - Added stable `Bug ID` traceback to sprint readiness backlog tables, introduced `Scout flagged` for code/PRD/API scouting leads that need prioritized manual testing, and updated `create-bug-tasks` to preserve source rows as `Source Bug ID`.
- **2026-06-22**: `FR018_AFFILIATE_CODE_GENERATION_ALIGNMENT_2026-06-22.md` - FR-018 affiliate-code ownership alignment: bulk generation now creates one distinct code per selected/filter-matched affiliate, shared affiliate payout codes are explicitly unsupported, generated codes appear in affiliate dashboards, FR-019 points readers back to FR-018 for affiliate-bound code generation, and FR-022 A-07 filters are synced for affiliate cohort selection.
- **2026-06-23**: `FR018_ATTRIBUTION_AND_DEPENDENCY_ALIGNMENT_2026-06-23.md` - FR-018 attribution follow-up: final price-discount priority is now separate from affiliate referral attribution, so provider-side promotions do not erase valid captured AFF commission credit; FR-017, FR-019, and FR-022 dependency references were aligned.
- **2026-06-22**: `SPRINT_1_A09A_QUESTIONNAIRE_RETRIAGE_2026-06-22.md` - Sprint 1 A-09a questionnaire re-triage: create/list/detail/version/audit are now confirmed live, historical questionnaire rows were kept open pending task cross-check, and the current questionnaire blocker is narrowed to Screen 2 access failures plus the missing post-create transition into question authoring.
- **2026-05-15**: `AGENT_GUIDELINES_SLIMDOWN_2026-05-15.md` - Slimmed `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to 101 lines each (from 284/277); deleted redundant skill catalog / deployment / generic enforcement sections, consolidated six scattered file/folder governance sections into a single `## File & Folder Rules` permission table, retained `local-docs/` directory tree and project-specific BLOCKING skills.
- **2026-05-06**: `PROGRESS_UPDATE_REPORT_2026-05-06.md` - Created a refreshed progress update report based on the January 27 milestone report structure, with fill-in sections for later PRD/FR checklist consolidation and fresh Provider/Admin code verification.
- **2026-04-18**: `FR014_BACKEND_ALIGNMENT_2026-04-18.md` - FR-014 follow-up alignment after verification: backend cross-check confirmed canonical patient-country provenance is `patients.location_id -> countries.id/name`; FR-014 now documents legacy `patients.location` only as a temporary fallback, removes unsupported IP-geolocation fallback wording, aligns the system PRD SLA parameter to a platform-wide target, and adds Screen 6 service dependencies (`S-03`, `S-05`)
- **2026-04-18**: `FR014_VERIFICATION_FIXES_V35_2026-04-18.md` - FR-014 PRD v3.4 → v3.5 verification fixes: Screen 6 PDF branding narrowed to `providers.profile_image` only; Rule 10 FX fallback capped at 48 hours; Assumption 8 added to record provider-side analytics widgets as PRD-derived by design (future passes must not re-flag as transcription discrepancies); Assumptions 9–10 added for FX freshness cap and legacy location UI indicator

- **2026-02-13**: `PLANE_API_IMPROVEMENTS_2026-02-13.md` - `plane-api-commands` automation improvements: HTML cleanup, issue-update support, skip-parameter support, and sandbox-handling notes
- **2026-02-13**: `SECRETS_SCAN_REPORT_2026-02-13.md` - Secrets scan confirming no hardcoded credentials under `local-docs/project-automation`
- **2026-04-09**: `UPDATE_LOG_ARCHIVE_REORGANIZATION_2026-04-09.md` - Archive maintenance pass moving misplaced February 13 reports into the canonical `update-logs/2026-02-13/` bucket and standardizing their filenames
