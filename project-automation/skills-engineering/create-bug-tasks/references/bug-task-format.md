</ul>
<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Step from source report.</li>

## Ordering Rules

- `Reference` must appear immediately after `Overview`, near the top of the description.
- `Scope Boundary` (split tasks only) appears immediately after `Reference`, before `Current Status`.
- Do not move references below `Current Status`, `Evidence`, or `Notes`.
- Include FR PRD/document/design links before details so developers can quickly recall the source requirement.

## Scope Boundary Rules (FE/BE Split)

- Include the `Scope Boundary` section only for tasks created by splitting a bug that spans both sides. Omit it entirely for FE-only and BE-only tasks.
- The section has exactly three fields:
  - **This task covers**: `FE side only.` or `BE side only.`
  - **Counterpart task**: the full name of the sibling task, using the opposite side prefix (`[BUG][BE] ...` on the FE task, `[BUG][FE] ...` on the BE task). Plane keys are unknown at draft time, so reference by name.
  - **Contract/handoff**: the shared API shape or data contract both sides depend on, stated in business/behavioral terms (not implementation detail).
- Both split tasks restate the same `Current Status`, `Steps to Reproduce`, `Evidence`, and `Notes` faithfully from the source.
- Each split task's `Expectation (Suggestion)` describes only that side's expected behavior.
- Labels follow the single-side rule: FE task uses `Bugs, FE Task`; BE task uses `Bugs, BE Task`. Never `Bugs, FE Task, BE Task`.

## Description Rules

- Keep each full task description under 300 words when practical.
- Use only business requirements, observable behavior, user-facing outcomes, and testable acceptance criteria.
- Do not include database schema, table/column designs, class names, function names, framework choices, or endpoint implementation instructions.
- Code/API evidence may appear in `Notes` only as evidence of observed mismatch; do not tell developers how to implement the fix.
- For backlog/report sources, preserve issue, steps, actual, expected, evidence, and notes closely.
- For direct user input, rewrite the bug to be clear, single-minded, and actionable without inventing additional requirements.

## Link Rules

- Use GitHub links in `Reference`, not local paths.
- GitHub base: `https://github.com/joachimtrungtuan/hairline-pm-docs/blob/main/`
- Strip the `local-docs/` prefix before appending the path.
- Every link must be raw-clickable: label text before the anchor, URL as anchor text.
- Include Figma/design only when provided or present in the source.
