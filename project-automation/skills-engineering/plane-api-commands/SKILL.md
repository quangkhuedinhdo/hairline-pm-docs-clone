# Plane API Commands

## Purpose

Run Plane.so API workflows with reusable scripts. All credentials come from `local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api/.env`; never print, copy, or hardcode secrets.

## Hard Rules

- Do not create new script files while using this skill.
- Use only the reusable scripts in `scripts/`; if a script cannot support the request, stop and propose a script update instead of writing a one-off.
- Do not hardcode task-specific IDs, Figma URLs, issue ranges, labels, modules, cycles, or parent values into scripts.
- Treat `Plane Task ID` as the internal Plane UUID. Store readable keys such as `HAIRL-1131` in `Plane Task Key`.
- Prefer cached Plane values from `plane-values.json`. Run `fetch-plane-values.py` to refresh the cache when values may have changed.
- Do not use deprecated `/issues/` endpoints. Use `/work-items/`.

## Files

- Env: `local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api/.env`
- Metadata cache: `local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api/plane-values.json`
- Scripts: `local-docs/project-automation/skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/`

## Supported Modes

- `refresh-values`: fetch labels, modules, cycles, states, issue types, priorities, and the currently active cycle into `plane-values.json`
- `create-work-item`: create new Plane work items from task markdown and write `Plane Task ID` / `Plane Task Key` back into the task file
- `update-work-item`: update existing work item descriptions from task markdown
- `set-parent`: assign parent work items for existing Plane work items
- `add-reference-links`: add raw clickable reference links to existing work item descriptions

## Task File Contract

Preferred metadata block:

```markdown
## TASK_NAME_START
[FE TASK] Task Name
## TASK_NAME_END

**Status**: Drafted
**Plane Task ID**:
**Plane Task Key**:
**FR**: FR-###
**Product Module**: PR-05
**Labels**: FE Task
**Priority**: Medium
**Plane Module**: [2] Dashboard > Provider
**Cycle**: 2026_May_C1
**Parent Task**:

## TASK_DESCRIPTION_START
<h2>Overview</h2>
...
## TASK_DESCRIPTION_END
```

Backward compatibility: creation and update scripts can parse older task blocks, but new tasks should use the preferred metadata.

Plane metadata is per task block. A single markdown file may legitimately contain different `Parent Task`, `Plane Module`, `Labels`, `Priority`, and `Cycle` values across tasks.

## Field Rules

- `Plane Task ID`: internal UUID returned by Plane. Leave blank before creation. If populated, do not recreate the task.
- `Plane Task Key`: readable key such as `HAIRL-1131`; informational only.
- `Labels`: comma-separated Plane label names or UUIDs. If blank, creation infers one label from prefix: `[FE TASK]` -> `FE Task`, `[BE TASK]` -> `BE Task`, `[BUG]` -> `Bugs`, `[UX/UI TASK]` -> `UX/UI`.
- `Priority`: default `Medium`; accepted values are `None`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Urgent`.
- `Plane Module`: Plane module name or UUID. Leave blank if no matching Plane module is intended.
- `Cycle`: Plane cycle name or UUID. If blank, the create script uses `active_cycle` from `plane-values.json`.
- `Parent Task`: user may provide a readable key such as `HAIRL-1131`; the create script resolves it to the internal UUID before creation. Internal UUID is also accepted.

## Workflow

### 1. Refresh Plane values

Use when the user asks to check Plane values or when labels/modules/cycles may have changed.

```bash
cd "local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api" && \
python3 "../../skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/fetch-plane-values.py" \
  --env ".env" \
  --output "plane-values.json"
```

The script prints added/removed/changed values and the active cycle. The cache contains no secrets.

### 2. Create Plane work items

Always dry-run first:

```bash
cd "local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api" && \
python3 "../../skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/create-plane-issues.py" \
  --file "/absolute/path/to/implementation-tasks-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md" \
  --env ".env" \
  --values "plane-values.json" \
  --dry-run
```

After user approval for live creation, rerun without `--dry-run`. The script writes internal UUIDs to `Plane Task ID` and readable keys to `Plane Task Key`.

Dry-run output must be reviewed per task. It prints resolved labels, module, cycle, and parent identity for each task, so mixed parent/module files are visible before live creation.

Creation enforcement order:

1. Create the work item
2. Immediately write `Plane Task ID` and `Plane Task Key` back into the task file so reruns cannot duplicate an already-created issue
3. Assign `Plane Module` through Plane's module work-item endpoint when present
4. Assign `Parent Task` through the work-item update endpoint when present
5. Assign `Cycle` through Plane's cycle work-item endpoint when present

If any required assignment fails, the script exits with an error instead of reporting success; the task file will still contain the created issue UUID for recovery.

### 2A. Interrupted Or Partial Runs

If the task file contains a mix of blank and populated `Plane Task ID` fields, do not rerun live creation in strict mode.

Use one of these recovery paths:

- `--resume`: skip tasks that already have `Plane Task ID`, and create only tasks whose ID is blank.
- `--skip N` / `--limit N`: select a known contiguous range of uncreated tasks.
- `--reset-local-ids --dry-run`: inspect which local IDs would be cleared if the previous Plane issues were test issues, deleted, or intentionally abandoned.

Strict mode intentionally fails when any selected task already has `Plane Task ID`. This prevents duplicate Plane issues.

Resume example:

```bash
cd "local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api" && \
python3 "../../skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/create-plane-issues.py" \
  --file "/absolute/path/to/implementation-tasks-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md" \
  --env ".env" \
  --values "plane-values.json" \
  --resume \
  --dry-run
```

Reset is local-only and does not delete or archive Plane issues. Use it only when duplicate creation is intentional:

```bash
cd "local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api" && \
python3 "../../skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/create-plane-issues.py" \
  --file "/absolute/path/to/implementation-tasks-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md" \
  --env ".env" \
  --values "plane-values.json" \
  --reset-local-ids \
  --dry-run
```

To actually clear local IDs, add `--confirm-reset-local-ids`. After reset, live creation will create new Plane issues from scratch.

### 3. Update Plane work items

Use stored `Plane Task ID` values whenever possible:

```bash
cd "local-docs/project-automation/task-creation/plane-api" && \
python3 "../../skills-engineering/plane-api-commands/scripts/update-plane-issues.py" \
  --file "/absolute/path/to/implementation-tasks-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md" \
  --env ".env" \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only after confirming the planned UUID mappings.

### 4. Set parents

Use `set-parent-by-sequence.py` only when the parent and children already exist and sequence IDs are known. Prefer adding parent metadata before creation for new tasks.

### 5. Add reference links

Use `add-reference-links-to-work-items.py` with `--link "Label=https://..."` or `--links-json`. The script has no built-in task-specific URLs.

## Validation

Before live writes:

1. Run `python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py`
2. Run `fetch-plane-values.py --dry-run` or a real refresh if cache update is needed
3. Check whether selected tasks have existing `Plane Task ID` values
4. For fresh creation, confirm all selected `Plane Task ID` fields are blank
5. For partial recovery, use `--resume` or a targeted `--skip` / `--limit` range
6. Run create/update scripts with `--dry-run`
7. Confirm the per-task parent/module/cycle distribution before live writes
