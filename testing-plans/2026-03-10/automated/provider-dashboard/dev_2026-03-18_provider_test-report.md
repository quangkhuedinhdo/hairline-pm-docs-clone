## How to Use This Document

### Before Testing

1. Read `test-requirements.md` in this folder and `testing-strategy.md` in the parent folder.
2. Set up the local environment per the checklist in `test-requirements.md`.
3. Seed the database with `FullSeeder`.

### Writing Test Scripts

1. Each row in the checklist = one test case (or one parameterized test group).
2. Use the **TC ID** as the test name/description in your spec file.
3. The **Preconditions** column tells you what setup/fixtures are needed.
4. The **Expected Result** column is your assertion target.
5. Rows marked **[PARAM]** require parameterized tests — implement with data providers (PHPUnit) or `for` loops / `test.describe` (Playwright).

### Filling In Results After Each Test Run

For each test case row, fill in:

| Field | How to Fill |
|-------|------------|
| **Status** | `PASS` — test passed. `FAIL` — assertion failed. `BLOCKED` — could not run due to dependency/environment issue. `SKIP` — intentionally skipped (explain in Notes). |
| **Actual Result** | If PASS: leave blank or write "As expected". If FAIL: describe what happened (e.g., "returned 500 instead of 422", "button not found", "total showed $450 instead of $500"). Keep it factual, one sentence. |
| **Severity** | If FAIL: `Critical` (blocks treatment flow, data loss), `High` (major feature broken), `Medium` (feature partially works or workaround exists), `Low` (cosmetic or minor). If PASS: leave blank. |
| **Notes** | Optional. Use for: root cause hypothesis, related failing tests, environment issues, flaky behavior. |

### TC ID Numbering

Some TC IDs are non-sequential (e.g., P-ONB-005 → P-ONB-008). These gaps are intentional — test cases were removed during scope refinement. Do not treat missing IDs as missing tests; the checklist below is the complete set.

### After Testing

1. Count totals: total PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, SKIP.
2. List all FAIL items grouped by severity in the [Summary section](#summary) at the bottom.
3. For each FAIL, write the gap: what business rule is violated, what is the risk if unfixed.

### Parameterized Test Guidelines

When defining the parameter list for a `[PARAM]` test case:

1. **Identify boundaries:** Include the minimum valid value, maximum valid value, one below minimum, one above maximum, and a typical middle value.
2. **Include valid and invalid inputs:** Every parameterized set should have at least one clearly valid and one clearly invalid input to verify both acceptance and rejection.
3. **Document expected output per row:** Each parameter row must state the specific expected result (not just "pass/fail" — state what the system should return or display).
4. **Cover data types:** Where applicable, include null, empty string, zero, negative, very large, and special character inputs.
5. **Business-critical values first:** Prioritize values that correspond to real business thresholds (e.g., expiry boundaries, payment minimums, SLA limits).
6. **Keep sets manageable:** Aim for 6–12 rows per parameterized group. If more are needed, split into focused sub-groups.

## Summary

**Fill this section after completing the test run.**

### Run Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total test cases | 278 |
| PASS | 23 |
| FAIL | 0 |
| BLOCKED | 256 |
| SKIP | 0 |
| Pass rate | 8.27% |

### Failures by Severity

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 0 |

### Gaps & Discrepancies Found

List each FAIL grouped by the business rule it violates. For each gap, describe:

1. **What is broken:** (one sentence)
2. **Business rule violated:** (FR reference + specific rule)
3. **Risk if unfixed:** (what could go wrong for users/business)
4. **Affected test cases:** (TC IDs)

| # | What is Broken | FR Violated | Risk if Unfixed | TC IDs |
|---|---------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | No FAIL observed in executed FE+BE provider automation scope for this run. | N/A | Remaining risk comes from unimplemented automation coverage, not from executed failures. | Executed PASS set (23 TC IDs) |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |

### Blocked Items

List any tests that could not run and why:

| TC ID | Reason Blocked | Action Needed |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Remaining non-executed checklist rows (255 TC IDs) | Automation for these rows is not implemented yet in FE/BE suites; represented by `test.fixme` blockers in current baseline. | Implement deterministic automation per module and rerun to convert BLOCKED into PASS/FAIL evidence. |

### Recommendations

1. Continue implementing provider checklist automation module-by-module (Onboarding -> Inquiry -> Quote -> Appointment -> Treatment -> Aftercare) to reduce the 256 BLOCKED cases.
2. Keep strict auth/contract assertions in backend provider tests so permission regressions remain visible early.
3. Keep provider smoke/auth tests deterministic by handling onboarding modal preconditions before navbar interactions.
4. Re-run FE and BE suites after each batch and update this report row-level immediately to maintain traceability.
